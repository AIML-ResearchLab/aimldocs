| **Tasks**     | Discrete units of work assigned to agents (e.g., "Summarize a report", "Extract financial KPIs")      |
| **Crew**      | A team of agents orchestrated to execute a full task plan                                             |
| **Crew Flow** | The execution pipeline that controls how the agents collaborate to complete the full workflow         |

## Why CrewAI?

![crewai](./image/crewai-1.png)

CrewAI unlocks the true potential of multi-agent automation, delivering the best-in-class combination of speed, flexibility, and control with either Crews of AI Agents or Flows of Events:

- **Standalone Framework:** Built from scratch, independent of LangChain or any other agent framework.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage, enabling faster execution.
- **Flexible Low Level Customization:** Complete freedom to customize at both high and low levels - from overall workflows and system architecture to granular agent behaviors, internal prompts, and execution logic.
- **Ideal for Every Use Case:** Proven effective for both simple tasks and highly complex, real-world, enterprise-grade scenarios.

## Understanding Flows and Crews
CrewAI offers two powerful, complementary approaches that work seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:

1. **Crews:** Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:
    - Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents
    - Dynamic task delegation and collaboration
    - Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise
    - Flexible problem-solving approaches

2. **Flows:** Production-ready, event-driven workflows that deliver precise control over complex automations. Flows provide:
    - Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios
    - Secure, consistent state management between tasks
    - Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code
    - Conditional branching for complex business logic

The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:

    - Build complex, production-grade applications
    - Balance autonomy with precise control
    - Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios
    - Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

## Getting Started with Installation
To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Installation

- Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system.
- CrewAI uses **UV** for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, install CrewAI:

```
pip install crewai
```

If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:

```
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Common Issues
1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named** ```'tiktoken'```

    - Install tiktoken explicitly: pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'
    -If using embedchain or other tools: pip install 'crewai[tools]'

2. **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**

    - Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)
    - For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
    - Try upgrading pip: ```pip install --upgrade pip```
    - If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: ```pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary```


## 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:

```
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .env
└── src/
    └── my_project/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── main.py
        ├── crew.py
        ├── tools/
        │   ├── custom_tool.py
        │   └── __init__.py
        └── config/
            ├── agents.yaml
            └── tasks.yaml
```

- You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the ```src/my_project``` folder.
- Entry point of the project, the ```crew.py``` file is where you define your crew.
- The ```agents.yaml``` file is where you define your agents
- The ```tasks.yaml``` file is where you define your tasks.

**To customize your project, you can:**
- Modify ```src/my_project/config/agents.yaml``` to define your agents.
- Modify ```src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml``` to define your tasks.
- Modify ```src/my_project/crew.py``` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
- Modify ```src/my_project/main.py``` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
- Add your environment variables into the ```.env``` file.


## Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

Instantiate your crew:

```
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
```

Modify the files as needed to fit your use case:

**agents.yaml**

```
# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml

  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

**crew.py**

```
# src/my_project/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
	"""LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
	agents: List[BaseAgent]
	tasks: List[Task]

	@agent
	def researcher(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
			verbose=True,
			tools=[SerperDevTool()]
		)

	@agent
	def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
			verbose=True
		)

	@task
	def research_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
		)

	@task
	def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
			output_file='report.md'
		)

	@crew
	def crew(self) -> Crew:
		"""Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

**main.py**

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/my_project/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

## 3. Running Your Crew

Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your .env file:

- An OpenAI API key (or other LLM API key): ```OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...```
- A Serper.dev API key: ```SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE```

Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

```
cd my_project
crewai install (Optional)
```

To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:

```
crewai run
```

or

```
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If an error happens due to the usage of poetry, please run the following command to update your crewai package:

```
crewai update
```

You should see the output in the console and the ```report.md``` file should be created in the root of your project with the full final report.

## In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results.


## Code Snippet Example

```
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define agents
analyst = Agent(role="Risk Analyst", ...)
modeler = Agent(role="Credit Modeler", ...)
writer = Agent(role="Report Generator", ...)

# Assign tasks
tasks = [
    Task(agent=analyst, description="Collect applicant financial info"),
    Task(agent=modeler, description="Run risk model and produce score"),
    Task(agent=writer, description="Write risk report and recommendation")
]

# Define Crew (Flow)
credit_assessment_crew = Crew(
    agents=[analyst, modeler, writer],
    tasks=tasks,
    process="sequential"  # could also be "async" or "concurrent"
)

# Execute the flow
output = credit_assessment_crew.run()
print(output)
```

## Practical Evaluation Framework
To determine the right approach for your specific use case, follow this step-by-step evaluation framework:

**Step 1: Assess Complexity**
Rate your application’s complexity on a scale of 1-10 by considering:

1. **Number of steps**: How many distinct operations are required?

- 1-3 steps: Low complexity (1-3)
- 4-7 steps: Medium complexity (4-7)
- 8+ steps: High complexity (8-10)


2. **Interdependencies**: How interconnected are the different parts?

- Few dependencies: Low complexity (1-3)
- Some dependencies: Medium complexity (4-7)
- Many complex dependencies: High complexity (8-10)

3. **Conditional logic**: How much branching and decision-making is needed?

- **Linear process**: Low complexity (1-3)
- **Some branching**: Medium complexity (4-7)
- **Complex decision trees**: High complexity (8-10)

4. **Domain knowledge**: How specialized is the knowledge required?

- **General knowledge**: Low complexity (1-3)
- **Some specialized knowledge**: Medium complexity (4-7)
- **Deep expertise in multiple domains**: High complexity (8-10)


## Step 2: Assess Precision Requirements

1. **Output structure**: How structured must the output be?
    - **Free-form text**: Low precision (1-3)
    - **Semi-structured**: Medium precision (4-7)
    - **Strictly formatted (JSON, XML)**: High precision (8-10)

2. **Accuracy needs**: How important is factual accuracy?
    - **Creative content:** Low precision (1-3)
    - **Informational content:** Medium precision (4-7)

    - **Variation acceptable**: Low precision (1-3)
    - **Some consistency needed**: Medium precision (4-7)
    - **Exact reproducibility required**: High precision (8-10)

4. **Error tolerance**: What is the impact of errors?
    - **Low impact**: Low precision (1-3)
    - **Moderate impact**: Medium precision (4-7)
    - **High impact**: High precision (8-10)

## Step 3: Map to the Matrix

Plot your complexity and precision scores on the matrix:

- **Low Complexity (1-4), Low Precision (1-4)**: Simple Crews
- **Low Complexity (1-4), High Precision (5-10)**: Flows with direct LLM calls
- **High Complexity (5-10), Low Precision (1-4)**: Complex Crews
- **High Complexity (5-10), High Precision (5-10)**: Flows orchestrating Crews

## Step 4: Consider Additional Factors

Beyond complexity and precision, consider:

1. **Development time**: Crews are often faster to prototype
2. **Maintenance needs**: Flows provide better long-term maintainability
3. **Team expertise**: Consider your team’s familiarity with different approaches
4. **Scalability requirements**: Flows typically scale better for complex applications
5. **Integration needs**: Consider how the solution will integrate with existing systems


## Crafting Effective Agents
Learn best practices for designing powerful, specialized AI agents that collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.

## The Art and Science of Agent Design
At the heart of CrewAI lies the agent - a specialized AI entity designed to perform specific roles within a collaborative framework. While creating basic agents is simple, crafting truly effective agents that produce exceptional results requires understanding key design principles and best practices.

This guide will help you master the art of agent design, enabling you to create specialized AI personas that collaborate effectively, think critically, and produce high-quality outputs tailored to your specific needs.

## Why Agent Design Matters?

The way you define your agents significantly impacts:

1. **Output quality**: Well-designed agents produce more relevant, high-quality results

2. **Collaboration effectiveness**: Agents with complementary skills work together more efficiently

3. **Task performance**: Agents with clear roles and goals execute tasks more effectively

4. **System scalability**: Thoughtfully designed agents can be reused across multiple crews and contexts

## Let’s explore best practices for creating agents that excel in these dimensions.

## The 80/20 Rule: Focus on Tasks Over Agents

When building effective AI systems, remember this crucial principle: **80% of your effort should go into designing tasks, and only 20% into defining agents**.

Why? Because even the most perfectly defined agent will fail with poorly designed tasks, but well-designed tasks can elevate even a simple agent. This means:

- Spend most of your time writing clear task instructions
- Define detailed inputs and expected outputs
- Add examples and context to guide execution
- Dedicate the remaining time to agent role, goal, and backstory

This doesn’t mean agent design isn’t important - it absolutely is. But task design is where most execution failures occur, so prioritize accordingly.

## Core Principles of Effective Agent Design

**1. The Role-Goal-Backstory Framework**
The most powerful agents in CrewAI are built on a strong foundation of three key elements:

**Role: The Agent’s Specialized Function**
The role defines what the agent does and their area of expertise. When crafting roles:

- **Be specific and specialized**: Instead of “Writer,” use “Technical Documentation Specialist” or “Creative Storyteller”

- **Align with real-world professions**: Base roles on recognizable professional archetypes

- **Include domain expertise**: Specify the agent’s field of knowledge (e.g., “Financial Analyst specializing in market trends”)

**Examples of effective roles:**

```
role: "Senior UX Researcher specializing in user interview analysis"
role: "Full-Stack Software Architect with expertise in distributed systems"
role: "Corporate Communications Director specializing in crisis management"
```


## Goal: The Agent’s Purpose and Motivation

The goal directs the agent’s efforts and shapes their decision-making process. Effective goals should:

- **Be clear and outcome-focused**: Define what the agent is trying to achieve

- **Emphasize quality standards**: Include expectations about the quality of work

- **Incorporate success criteria**: Help the agent understand what “good” looks like

**Examples of effective goals:**

```
goal: "Uncover actionable user insights by analyzing interview data and identifying recurring patterns, unmet needs, and improvement opportunities"
goal: "Design robust, scalable system architectures that balance performance, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness"
goal: "Craft clear, empathetic crisis communications that address stakeholder concerns while protecting organizational reputation"
```

## Backstory: The Agent’s Experience and Perspective

The backstory gives depth to the agent, influencing how they approach problems and interact with others. Good backstories:

- **Establish expertise and experience**: Explain how the agent gained their skills
- **Define working style and values**: Describe how the agent approaches their work
- **Create a cohesive persona**: Ensure all elements of the backstory align with the role and goal

**Examples of effective backstories:**

```
backstory: "You have spent 15 years conducting and analyzing user research for top tech companies. You have a talent for reading between the lines and identifying patterns that others miss. You believe that good UX is invisible and that the best insights come from listening to what users don't say as much as what they do say."

backstory: "With 20+ years of experience building distributed systems at scale, you've developed a pragmatic approach to software architecture. You've seen both successful and failed systems and have learned valuable lessons from each. You balance theoretical best practices with practical constraints and always consider the maintenance and operational aspects of your designs."

backstory: "As a seasoned communications professional who has guided multiple organizations through high-profile crises, you understand the importance of transparency, speed, and empathy in crisis response. You have a methodical approach to crafting messages that address concerns while maintaining organizational credibility."
```

## 2. Specialists Over Generalists

Agents perform significantly better when given specialized roles rather than general ones. A highly focused agent delivers more precise, relevant outputs:


**Generic (Less Effective):**

```
role: "Writer"
```

**Specialized (More Effective):**

```
role: "Technical Blog Writer specializing in explaining complex AI concepts to non-technical audiences"
```

**Specialist Benefits:**

- Clearer understanding of expected output
- More consistent performance
- Better alignment with specific tasks
- Improved ability to make domain-specific judgments

## 3. Balancing Specialization and Versatility
Effective agents strike the right balance between specialization (doing one thing extremely well) and versatility (being adaptable to various situations):

- **Specialize in role, versatile in application**: Create agents with specialized skills that can be applied across multiple contexts

- **Avoid overly narrow definitions**: Ensure agents can handle variations within their domain of expertise

- **Consider the collaborative context**: Design agents whose specializations complement the other agents they’ll work with

## 4. Setting Appropriate Expertise Levels

The expertise level you assign to your agent shapes how they approach tasks:

- **Novice agents**: Good for straightforward tasks, brainstorming, or initial drafts

- **Intermediate agents**: Suitable for most standard tasks with reliable execution

- **Expert agents:** Best for complex, specialized tasks requiring depth and nuance

- **World-class agents**: Reserved for critical tasks where exceptional quality is needed

Choose the appropriate expertise level based on task complexity and quality requirements. For most collaborative crews, a mix of expertise levels often works best, with higher expertise assigned to core specialized functions.


## Practical Examples: Before and After

Let’s look at some examples of agent definitions before and after applying these best practices:

## Example 1: Content Creation Agent

**Before:**

```
role: "Writer"
goal: "Write good content"
backstory: "You are a writer who creates content for websites."
```

**After:**

```
role: "B2B Technology Content Strategist"
goal: "Create compelling, technically accurate content that explains complex topics in accessible language while driving reader engagement and supporting business objectives"
backstory: "You have spent a decade creating content for leading technology companies, specializing in translating technical concepts for business audiences. You excel at research, interviewing subject matter experts, and structuring information for maximum clarity and impact. You believe that the best B2B content educates first and sells second, building trust through genuine expertise rather than marketing hype."
```

## Example 2: Research Agent

**Before:**

```
role: "Researcher"
goal: "Find information"
backstory: "You are good at finding information online."
```

**After:**

```
role: "Academic Research Specialist in Emerging Technologies"
goal: "Discover and synthesize cutting-edge research, identifying key trends, methodologies, and findings while evaluating the quality and reliability of sources"
backstory: "With a background in both computer science and library science, you've mastered the art of digital research. You've worked with research teams at prestigious universities and know how to navigate academic databases, evaluate research quality, and synthesize findings across disciplines. You're methodical in your approach, always cross-referencing information and tracing claims to primary sources before drawing conclusions."
```

## Crafting Effective Tasks for Your Agents

While agent design is important, task design is critical for successful execution. Here are best practices for designing tasks that set your agents up for success:

## The Anatomy of an Effective Task
A well-designed task has two key components that serve different purposes:

## Task Description: The Process
The description should focus on what to do and how to do it, including:

- Detailed instructions for execution
- Context and background information
- Scope and constraints
- Process steps to follow

## Expected Output: The Deliverable
The expected output should define what the final result should look like:

- Format specifications (markdown, JSON, etc.)
- Structure requirements
- Quality criteria
- Examples of good outputs (when possible)

## Task Design Best Practices

## 1. Single Purpose, Single Output

Tasks perform best when focused on one clear objective:

## Bad Example (Too Broad):

```
task_description: "Research market trends, analyze the data, and create a visualization."
```

## Good Example (Focused):

```
# Task 1
research_task:
  description: "Research the top 5 market trends in the AI industry for 2024."
  expected_output: "A markdown list of the 5 trends with supporting evidence."

# Task 2
analysis_task:
  description: "Analyze the identified trends to determine potential business impacts."
  expected_output: "A structured analysis with impact ratings (High/Medium/Low)."

# Task 3
visualization_task:
  description: "Create a visual representation of the analyzed trends."
  expected_output: "A description of a chart showing trends and their impact ratings."
```

## 2. Be Explicit About Inputs and Outputs

Always clearly specify what inputs the task will use and what the output should look like:

**Example:**

```
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the customer feedback data from the CSV file.
    Focus on identifying recurring themes related to product usability.
    Consider sentiment and frequency when determining importance.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown report with the following sections:
    1. Executive summary (3-5 bullet points)
    2. Top 3 usability issues with supporting data
    3. Recommendations for improvement
```


## 3. Include Purpose and Context
Explain why the task matters and how it fits into the larger workflow:

**Example:**

```
competitor_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze our three main competitors' pricing strategies.
    This analysis will inform our upcoming pricing model revision.
    Focus on identifying patterns in how they price premium features
    and how they structure their tiered offerings.
```

## 4. Use Structured Output Tools
For machine-readable outputs, specify the format clearly:

**Example:**

```
data_extraction_task:
  description: "Extract key metrics from the quarterly report."
  expected_output: "JSON object with the following keys: revenue, growth_rate, customer_acquisition_cost, and retention_rate."
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Based on lessons learned from real-world implementations, here are the most common pitfalls in agent and task design:

## 1. Unclear Task Instructions
**Problem:** Tasks lack sufficient detail, making it difficult for agents to execute effectively.

**Example of Poor Design:**

```
research_task:
  description: "Research AI trends."
  expected_output: "A report on AI trends."
```
