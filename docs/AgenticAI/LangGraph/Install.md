# Install LangGraph - LangGraph v1.0

## To install the base LangGraph package:

**pip:**
```
pip install -U langgraph
```

**uv:**
```
uv add langgraph
```

## To use LangGraph you will usually want to access LLMs and define tools. 

- One way to do this (is to use ```LangChain```.)

## Install LangChain with:

**pip:**
```
# Requires Python 3.10+
pip install -U langchain
```

**uv:**
```
# Requires Python 3.10+
uv add langchain
```

## To work with specific LLM provider packages, you will need install them separately.
