<h3 style="color:blue;">ðŸ“Œ What is Parametric Tests?</h3>
**Parametric tests** are statistical tests that **assume the data follows a known distribution** â€” usually a **normal distribution**.

**âœ… Key Assumptions of Parametric Tests:**

1. **Normal distribution** of the data (bell curve).

2. **Homogeneity of variances** (equal variance across groups).

3. **Interval or ratio scale data** (numeric, continuous).

4. Observations are **independent**.

**ðŸ§  Why Use Parametric Tests?**

- âœ… More powerful and sensitive

- âœ… Provide precise estimates

- âœ… Widely used in scientific and business analysis

**ðŸ“š Types of Parametric Tests**

| Test Name               | Purpose                                     | Use Case Example                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Z-test**              | Compare means or proportions (large sample) | Compare sample mean to known population mean   |
| **T-test**              | Compare means of one/two/paired groups      | Test if two drugs have different effects       |
| **ANOVA**               | Compare means of 3 or more groups           | Compare exam scores across 3 schools           |
| **F-test**              | Compare variances between groups            | Check if two machines have equal variability   |
| **Pearson Correlation** | Test linear relationship between variables  | Is height linearly related to weight?          |
| **Linear Regression**   | Predict one variable from another           | Predict house price based on area and location |


**Breakdown of T-Tests (most used parametric tests)**

| T-test Type           | Use Case                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-sample t-test** | Sample mean vs known population mean               |
| **Two-sample t-test** | Compare means of two independent groups            |
| **Paired t-test**     | Compare means of the **same group** (before/after) |
