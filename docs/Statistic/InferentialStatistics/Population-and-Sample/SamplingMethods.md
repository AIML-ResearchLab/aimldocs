<h2 style="color:red;">✅ Sampling Methods</h2>


<h3 style="color:blue;">📌 What is Sampling Methods?</h3>
A sampling method is the strategy or approach used to select a subset (sample) from a larger population for analysis.

Since it’s often impractical to study an entire population, sampling methods allow you to collect representative data efficiently, while ensuring accuracy and minimizing bias.

**🧠 Purpose of Sampling Methods**

- To reduce cost and effort.

- To ensure the sample represents the population well.

- To make valid statistical inferences (e.g., mean, proportion, variance).


## 🔰 Two Major Categories of Sampling Methods

**1. 🧪 Probability Sampling**

Every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

✅ Best for reducing bias and making strong statistical conclusions.

**Common Techniques:**

| Method                  | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Random**       | Every member has equal chance of selection                        |
| **Stratified Sampling** | Population divided into subgroups (strata); sample from each      |
| **Systematic Sampling** | Select every k-th item after a random start                       |
| **Cluster Sampling**    | Divide into groups (clusters), then randomly select entire groups |



**2. 🧾 Non-Probability Sampling**

Not every member has a known or equal chance of selection.

✅ Easier and faster, but more prone to bias.

**Common Techniques:**

| Method                   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Convenience Sampling** | Choose whoever is easiest to reach                                    |
| **Judgmental Sampling**  | Use expert judgment to pick samples                                   |
| **Quota Sampling**       | Select samples to meet quotas for specific traits                     |
| **Snowball Sampling**    | Existing subjects recruit future subjects (common in social research) |

**📌 Example:**

**Goal:** Survey students about exam stress.

| Sampling Method        | Example                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Random Sampling | Randomly select 100 students from the entire list.       |
| Stratified Sampling    | Select 50 males and 50 females randomly from each group. |
| Convenience Sampling   | Ask students who are near the library.                   |
| Snowball Sampling      | Ask one student to refer other friends.                  |
