Effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources. Feature engineering in ML lifecycle diagram # Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into a format that enhances the performance of machine learning models. The key steps in feature engineering include: Data Exploration and Understanding: Explore and understand the dataset, including the types of features and their distributions. Understanding the shape of the data is key. Handling Missing Data: Address missing values through imputation or removal of instances or features with missing data. There are many algorithmic approaches to handling missing data. Variable Encoding: Convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms using methods. Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, improving model performance. Feature Creation: Generate new features by combining existing ones to capture relationships between variables. Handling Outliers: Identify and address outliers in the data through techniques like trimming or transforming the data. Normalization: Normalize features to bring them to a common scale, important for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes. Binning or Discretization: Convert continuous features into discrete bins to capture specific patterns in certain ranges. Text Data Processing: If dealing with text data, perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. Time Series Features: Extract relevant timebased features such as lag features or rolling statistics for time series data. Vector Features: Vector features are commonly used for training in machine learning. In machine learning, data is represented in the form of features, and these features are often organized into vectors. A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction and can be represented as an array of numbers. Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features to improve model interpretability and efficiency using techniques like univariate feature selection or recursive feature elimination. Feature Extraction: Feature extraction aims to reduce data complexity (often known as \u201cdata dimensionality\u201d) while retaining as much relevant information as possible. This helps to improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning algorithms and simplify the analysis process. Feature extraction may involve the creation of new features (\u201cfeature engineering\u201d) and data manipulation to separate and simplify the use of meaningful features from irrelevant ones. Create new features or reduce dimensionality using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-DSNE). Cross-validation: selecting features prior to cross-validation can introduce significant bias. Evaluate the impact of feature engineering on model performance using cross-validation techniques. Common feature types: # Numerical: Values with numeric types (int, float, etc.). Examples: age, salary, height. Categorical Features: Features that can take one of a limited number of values. Examples: gender (male, female, non-binary), color (red, blue, green). Ordinal Features: Categorical features that have a clear ordering. Examples: T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL). Binary Features: A special case of categorical features with only two categories. Examples: is_smoker (yes, no), has_subscription (true, false). Text Features: Features that contain textual data. Textual data typically requires special preprocessing steps (like tokenization) to transform it into a format suitable for machine learning models. Feature normalization # Since data features can be measured on different scales, it's often necessary to standardize or normalize them, especially when using algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude and scale of variables (like gradient descent-based algorithms, k-means clustering, or support vector machines). Normalization standardizes the range of independent variables or features of the data. This process can make certain algorithms converge faster and lead to better model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input features. Feature normalization helps in the following ways: Scale Sensitivity: Features on larger scales can disproportionately influence the outcome. Better Performance: Normalization can lead to better performance in many machine learning models by ensuring that each feature contributes approximately proportionate to the final decision. This is especially meaningful for optimization algorithms, as they can achieve convergence more quickly with normalized features. Some features, however, may need to have a larger influence on the outcome. In addition, normalization may result in some loss of useful information. Therefore, be judicious when applying normalization during the feature extraction process.","title":"What is Feature Engineering?"},{"location":"AIML/FeatureEngineering.html#what-is-feature-engineering","text":"Feature engineering, in data science, refers to manipulation \u2014 addition, deletion, combination, mutation \u2014 of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.

It supports multi-dimensional arrays (matrices) and provides a wide range of mathematical functions for array operations. It is used in scientific computing, and in areas like data analysis, machine learning, etc. Why to Use NumPy? # In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important. NumPy provides various math functions for calculations like addition, algebra, and data analysis. NumPy provides various objects representing arrays and multi-dimensional arrays which can be used to handle large data such as images, sounds, etc. NumPy also works with other libraries like SciPy (for scientific computing), Pandas (for data analysis), and scikit-learn (for machine learning). NumPy is fast and reliable, which makes it a great choice for numerical computing in Python. Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists? # NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science. This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures. Which Language is NumPy written in? # NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++. NumPy Applications # The following are some common application areas where NumPy is extensively used: Data Analysis: In Data analysis, while handling data, we can create data (in the form of array objects), filter the data, and perform various operations such as mean, finding the standard deviations, etc. Machine Learning & AI: Popular machine learning tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch use NumPy to manage input data, handle model parameters, and process the output values. Array Manipulation: NumPy allows you to create, resize, slice, index, stack, split, and combine arrays. Finance & Economics: NumPy is used for financial analysis, including portfolio optimization, risk assessment, time series analysis, and statistical modelling. Image & Signal Processing: NumPy helps process and analyze images and signals for various applications. Data Visualization: NumPy independently does not create visualizations, but it works with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate charts and graphs from numerical data. Example: 1 # Checking NumPy Version import numpy as np print ( np . __version__ ) Example: 2 # Create a NumPy array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) print ( arr ) Output: [1 2 3 4 5] print(type(arr)) = > <class 'numpy.ndarray'> Dimensions in Arrays # A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays). nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements. Scalar: A scalar is a single value \u2014 just one number, string, or boolean.It has no dimensions \u2014 it's just a standalone value. x = 5 # scalar (integer) y = 3.14 # scalar (float) z = \"hello\" # scalar (string) Array: An array is a collection of values \u2014 it can hold many numbers or elements, and it has one or more dimensions. import numpy as np a = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) # 1D array (vector) b = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]]) # 2D array (matrix) An array can be: - 1D (like a list) - 2D (like a table or matrix) - nD (higher-dimensional) Computation # Computation means carrying out calculations \u2014 it\u2019s the process of solving problems using mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, etc.), often with a computer. Matrix (Mathematical Structure) # A matrix is a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Example: A = | 1 2 | | 3 4 | This is a 2x2 matrix (2 rows, 2 columns). import numpy as np A = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]]) Types of matrix computations: # Addition: A + B Scalar multiplication: 3 * A Matrix multiplication: np.dot(A, B) or A @ B Transpose: A.T Inverse: np.linalg.inv(A) (if invertible) In AI/ML, matrices are everywhere: - Images are matrices of pixels - Neural networks use weight matrices - Data tables are often treated as matrices 0-D Arrays: # 0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array. Example: 3 # Create a 0-D array with value 42 import numpy as np arr = np . array ( 42 ) print ( arr ) Output: 42 1-D Arrays: # An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array. These are the most common and basic arrays. Example: 4 # Create a 1-D array containing the values 1,2,3,4,5 import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) print ( arr ) Output: [1 2 3 4 5] 2-D Arrays # An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array. These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors. NumPy has a whole sub module dedicated towards matrix operations called numpy.mat Example: 5 # Create a 2-D array containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]) print ( arr ) Output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] 3-D arrays # An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array. These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor. Example: 6 # Create a 3-D array with two 2-D arrays, both containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]], [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]]) print ( arr ) Output: [[[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]] Check Number of Dimensions? # NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have. Example: 7 # Check how many dimensions the arrays have: import numpy as np a = np . array ( 42 ) b = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) c = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]) d = np . array ([[[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]], [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]]) print ( a . ndim ) print ( b . ndim ) print ( c . ndim ) print ( d . ndim ) Output: 0 1 2 3 Higher Dimensional Arrays # An array can have any number of dimensions. When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument. Example: 8 # Create an array with 5 dimensions and verify that it has 5 dimensions: NumPy support maximum array of dimensions is = 64 MAXDIMS (=64) import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], ndmin = 5 ) print ( arr ) print ( 'number of dimensions :' , arr . ndim ) Output: [[[[[1 2 3 4]]]]] number of dimensions : 5 5th dim: In this array the innermost dimension (5th dim) has 4 elements. 4th dim: the 4th dim has 1 element that is the vector . 3rd dim: the 3rd dim has 1 element that is the matrix with the vector 2nd dim: the 2nd dim has 1 element that is 3D array. 1st dim: 1st dim has 1 element that is a 4D array. Key Concept: N-D Arrays Don't Automatically Treat Contents as Matrices # In NumPy: - A matrix is just a 2D array (with shape (rows, cols)). - A vector is a 1D array (shape (n,)). - A scalar has shape () (0D). Everything beyond 2D is a tensor \u2014 and all dimensions are just levels of nesting . NumPy only treats an array as a matrix if it\u2019s 2D , like: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]. Does NumPy Consider a 3D Array a Matrix? NumPy does not consider a 3D array a matrix . Why? In linear algebra, a matrix is strictly a 2D structure: it has rows and columns. NumPy follows this convention. # Shape Interpretation (3,) 1D array (vector) (3, 4) 2D array (matrix) (2, 3, 4) 3D array (tensor) (1, 1, 1, 1, 4) 5D tensor A 3D array in NumPy is: A stack of matrices (or a cube of numbers). Example: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ [[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]], [[ 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 ]] ]) Shape: (2, 2, 2) Interpretation: - 2 matrices - Each matrix is 2x2 Matrix vs Tensor in NumPy # Concept Description NumPy term Scalar 0D single value np.array(5) Vector 1D array np.array([1,2]) Matrix 2D array (rows \u00d7 cols) np.array([[1,2], [3,4]]) Tensor 3D+ array (e.g., 3D, 4D...) np.array([[[...]]]) NumPy Array Indexing # Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element. You can access an array element by referring to its index number. The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc. What is Indexing? Indexing is how you access elements inside a NumPy array using their position (like in a list). NumPy supports powerful indexing for: 1D, 2D, 3D+ arrays Slicing Boolean conditions Fancy indexing \u2705 1D Array Indexing # import numpy as np a = np . array ([ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ]) Access: print(a[0]) 10 print(a[-1]) 50 (last element) \u2705 2D Array Indexing (Matrix) # b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) 1 st row : b [ 0 , 0 ] # ( 1 st row , 1 st column ) b [ 0 , 1 ] # ( 1 st row , 2 nd column ), like wise . 2 nd row : b [ 1 , 0 ] # ( 2 nd row , 1 st column ) b [ 1 , 2 ] # ( 2 nd row , 3 rd column ) 3 rd row : b [ 2 , 0 ] # ( 3 rd row , 1 st column ) b [ 2 , 1 ] # ( 3 rd row , 2 nd column ) whole 3 rd row : b [ 2 ] # \u2192 [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] ( whole 3 rd row ) whole 2 nd column : b [ :, 1 ] # \u2192 [ 2 , 5 , 8 ] ( whole 2 nd column ) \u2705 3D Array Indexing (Tensor) # c = np.array([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]] ]) Shape: (2, 2, 2) Access: c [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] -> 1 c [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] -> 2 c [ 1 , 1 , 0 ] -> 7 NumPy Array Slicing # Slicing arrays Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index. We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end]. We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step]. If we don't pass start its considered 0 If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension If we don't pass step its considered 1 \u2702\ufe0f Slicing # a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) a[1:4] # \u2192 [20 30 40] a[:3] # \u2192 [10 20 30] a[::2] # \u2192 [10 30 50] (every 2nd element) 2D slicing: b = np.array([ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]) b[0:2, 1:] # \u2192 [[2, 3], [5, 6]] - 0:2 \u2192 select rows 0 and 1 (i.e., the first two rows) - 1: \u2192 select columns starting from index 1 (i.e., the second and third columns) \ud83e\udde0 Boolean Indexing # a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) a[a > 3] # \u2192 [4 5] Negative Slicing # Use the minus operator to refer to an index from the end: Example Slice from the index 3 from the end to index 1 from the end: arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]) print ( arr [ - 3 :- 1 ]) Output : [ 5 6 ] STEP # Use the step value to determine the step of the slicing: Example Return every other element from index 1 to index 5: arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) Output: [2 4] Example Return every other element from the entire array: arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) print(arr[::2]) Output: [1 3 5 7] Slicing 2-D Arrays # Example From the second element, slice elements from index 1 to index 4 (not included): arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]) print(arr[1, 1:4]) Output: [7 8 9] Example From both elements, return index 2: arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]) print(arr[0:2, 2]) Output: [3 8] Example From both elements, slice index 1 to index 4 (not included), this will return a 2-D array: arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]) print(arr[0:2, 1:4]) Output: [[2 3 4] [7 8 9]] NumPy Data Types # Data Types in Python # By default Python have these data types: strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. \"ABCD\" integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3 float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42 boolean - used to represent True or False. complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j Data Types in NumPy # NumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc. Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them. i - integer b - boolean u - unsigned integer f - float c - complex float m - timedelta M - datetime O - object S - string U - unicode string V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void ) Checking the Data Type of an Array # The NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type of the array: Example: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]) print ( arr . dtype ) Converting Data Type on Existing Arrays # The best way to change the data type of an existing array, is to make a copy of the array with the astype() method. The astype() function creates a copy of the array, and allows you to specify the data type as a parameter. The data type can be specified using a string, like 'f' for float, 'i' for integer etc. or you can use the data type directly like float for float and int for integer. Example Change data type from float to integer by using 'i' as parameter value: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1.1 , 2.1 , 3.1 ]) newarr = arr . astype ( 'i' ) print ( newarr ) print ( newarr . dtype ) NumPy Array Copy vs View # The Difference Between Copy and View # The main difference between a copy and a view of an array is that the copy is a new array, and the view is just a view of the original array. The copy owns the data and any changes made to the copy will not affect original array, and any changes made to the original array will not affect the copy. The view does not own the data and any changes made to the view will affect the original array, and any changes made to the original array will affect the view. COPY: # ExampleGet Make a copy, change the original array, and display both arrays: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) x = arr . copy () arr [ 0 ] = 42 print ( arr ) print ( x ) Output : [ 42 2 3 4 5 ] [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] VIEW: # Example Make a view, change the original array, and display both arrays: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) x = arr . view () arr [ 0 ] = 42 print ( arr ) print ( x ) Output : [ 42 2 3 4 5 ] [ 42 2 3 4 5 ] Make a view, change the view, and display both arrays: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) x = arr . view () x [ 0 ] = 31 print ( arr ) print ( x ) Output : [ 31 2 3 4 5 ] [ 31 2 3 4 5 ] Check if Array Owns its Data # As mentioned above, copies owns the data, and views does not own the data, but how can we check this? Every NumPy array has the attribute base that returns None if the array owns the data. Otherwise, the base attribute refers to the original object. Example Print the value of the base attribute to check if an array owns it 's data or not: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) x = arr . copy () y = arr . view () print ( x . base ) print ( y . base ) Output : None [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] NumPy Array Shape # Shape of an Array The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension. Get the Shape of an Array # NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements. Example Print the shape of a 2-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]] ) print ( arr . shape ) Output : ( 2 , 4 ) The shape tells us : 2 \u2192 there are 2 rows \u2192 the first dimension ( axis 0 ) 4 \u2192 each row has 4 elements \u2192 the second dimension ( axis 1 ) [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], \u2190 1 st row [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] \u2190 2 nd row ] Columns \u2192 0 1 2 3 R +--------------- o | 1 2 3 4 w | 5 6 7 8 s \u2193 Example Create an array with 5 dimensions using ndmin using a vector with values 1,2,3,4 and verify that last dimension has value 4: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], ndmin = 5 ) print ( arr ) print ( 'shape of array :' , arr . shape ) Output : [[[[[ 1 2 3 4 ]]]]] shape of array : ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 ) NumPy Array Reshaping # Reshaping arrays Reshaping means changing the shape of an array. The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension. By reshaping we can add or remove dimensions or change number of elements in each dimension. Reshape From 1-D to 2-D # Example Convert the following 1-D array with 12 elements into a 2-D array. The outermost dimension will have 4 arrays, each with 3 elements: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ]) newarr = arr . reshape ( 4 , 3 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] [ 7 8 9 ] [ 10 11 12 ]] Reshape From 1-D to 3-D # Example Convert the following 1-D array with 12 elements into a 3-D array. The outermost dimension will have 2 arrays that contains 3 arrays, each with 2 elements: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ]) newarr = arr . reshape ( 2 , 3 , 2 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [[[ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] [ 5 6 ]] [[ 7 8 ] [ 9 10 ] [ 11 12 ]]] Can We Reshape Into any Shape? # Yes, as long as the elements required for reshaping are equal in both shapes. We can reshape an 8 elements 1D array into 4 elements in 2 rows 2D array but we cannot reshape it into a 3 elements 3 rows 2D array as that would require 3x3 = 9 elements. Example Try converting 1D array with 8 elements to a 2D array with 3 elements in each dimension (will raise an error): import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]) newarr = arr . reshape ( 3 , 3 ) print ( newarr ) Output : ValueError : cannot reshape array of size 8 into shape ( 3 , 3 ) Returns Copy or View? # Example Check if the returned array is a copy or a view: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]) print ( arr . reshape ( 2 , 4 ) . base ) Output : [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] -> The example above returns the original array , so it is a view . Unknown Dimension # You are allowed to have one \"unknown\" dimension. Meaning that you do not have to specify an exact number for one of the dimensions in the reshape method. Pass -1 as the value, and NumPy will calculate this number for you. Example Convert 1D array with 8 elements to 3D array with 2x2 elements: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]) newarr = arr . reshape ( 2 , 2 , - 1 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [[[ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ]] [[ 5 6 ] [ 7 8 ]]] Flattening the arrays # Flattening array means converting a multidimensional array into a 1D array. We can use reshape(-1) to do this. Example Convert the 2D array into a 1D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]) newarr = arr . reshape ( - 1 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] Note: There are a lot of functions for changing the shapes of arrays in numpy flatten , ravel and also for rearranging the elements rot90, flip, fliplr, flipud etc. These fall under Intermediate to Advanced section of numpy. NumPy Array Iterating # Iterating Arrays Iterating means going through elements one by one. As we deal with multi-dimensional arrays in numpy, we can do this using basic for loop of python. If we iterate on a 1-D array it will go through each element one by one. Example Iterate on the elements of the following 1-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) for x in arr : print ( x ) Output : 1 2 3 Iterating 2-D Arrays In a 2-D array it will go through all the rows. Example Iterate on the elements of the following 2-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]) for x in arr : print ( x ) Output : [ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] If we iterate on a n-D array it will go through n-1th dimension one by one. To return the actual values, the scalars, we have to iterate the arrays in each dimension. Example Iterate on each scalar element of the 2-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]]) for x in arr : for y in x : print ( y ) Output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 Iterating 3-D Arrays # In a 3-D array it will go through all the 2-D arrays. Example Iterate on the elements of the following 3-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]], [[ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]]]) for x in arr : print ( x ) Output : [[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ]] [[ 7 8 9 ] [ 10 11 12 ]] To return the actual values, the scalars, we have to iterate the arrays in each dimension. Example Iterate down to the scalars: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]], [[ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]]]) for x in arr : for y in x : for z in y : print ( z ) Output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Iterating Arrays Using nditer() # The function nditer() is a helping function that can be used from very basic to very advanced iterations. It solves some basic issues which we face in iteration, lets go through it with examples. Iterating on Each Scalar Element In basic for loops, iterating through each scalar of an array we need to use n for loops which can be difficult to write for arrays with very high dimensionality. Example Iterate through the following 3-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]], [[ 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 ]]]) for x in np . nditer ( arr ): print ( x ) Output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Iterating Array With Different Data Types # We can use op_dtypes argument and pass it the expected datatype to change the datatype of elements while iterating. NumPy does not change the data type of the element in-place (where the element is in array) so it needs some other space to perform this action, that extra space is called buffer, and in order to enable it in nditer() we pass flags=['buffered']. Example Iterate through the array as a string: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) for x in np . nditer ( arr , flags = [ 'buffered' ], op_dtypes = [ 'S' ]): print ( x ) Output : np . bytes_ ( b '1' ) np . bytes_ ( b '2' ) np . bytes_ ( b '3' ) Iterating With Different Step Size # We can use filtering and followed by iteration. Example Iterate through every scalar element of the 2D array skipping 1 element: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]]) for x in np . nditer ( arr [:, :: 2 ]): print ( x ) Output : 1 3 5 7 Enumerated Iteration Using ndenumerate() # Enumeration means mentioning sequence number of somethings one by one. Sometimes we require corresponding index of the element while iterating, the ndenumerate() method can be used for those usecases. Example Enumerate on following 1D arrays elements: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) for idx , x in np . ndenumerate ( arr ): print ( idx , x ) Output : ( 0 ,) 1 ( 1 ,) 2 ( 2 ,) 3 Example Enumerate on following 2D array's elements: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ], [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]]) for idx , x in np . ndenumerate ( arr ): print ( idx , x ) Output : ( 0 , 0 ) 1 ( 0 , 1 ) 2 ( 0 , 2 ) 3 ( 0 , 3 ) 4 ( 1 , 0 ) 5 ( 1 , 1 ) 6 ( 1 , 2 ) 7 ( 1 , 3 ) 8 NumPy Joining Array # Joining NumPy Arrays # Joining means putting contents of two or more arrays in a single array. In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes. We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the concatenate() function, along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0. ExampleGet your own Python Server Join two arrays import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) arr = np . concatenate (( arr1 , arr2 )) print ( arr ) Output : [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] Example Join two 2-D arrays along rows (axis=1): import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]]) arr2 = np . array ([[ 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 ]]) arr = np . concatenate (( arr1 , arr2 ), axis = 1 ) print ( arr ) Output : [[ 1 2 5 6 ] [ 3 4 7 8 ]] Joining Arrays Using Stack Functions # Stacking is same as concatenation, the only difference is that stacking is done along a new axis. We can concatenate two 1-D arrays along the second axis which would result in putting them one over the other, ie. stacking. We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the stack() method along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed it is taken as 0. Example import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) arr = np . stack (( arr1 , arr2 ), axis = 1 ) print ( arr ) Output : [[ 1 4 ] [ 2 5 ] [ 3 6 ]] Stacking Along Rows # NumPy provides a helper function: hstack() to stack along rows. Example import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) arr = np . hstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) print ( arr ) Output : [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] Stacking Along Columns # NumPy provides a helper function: vstack() to stack along columns. Example import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) arr = np . vstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) print ( arr ) Output : [[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ]] Stacking Along Height (depth) # NumPy provides a helper function: dstack() to stack along height, which is the same as depth. Example import numpy as np arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) arr = np . dstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) print ( arr ) Output : [[[ 1 4 ] [ 2 5 ] [ 3 6 ]]] NumPy Splitting Array # Splitting NumPy Arrays # Splitting is reverse operation of Joining. Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple. We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits. Example Split the array in 3 parts: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]) newarr = np . array_split ( arr , 3 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ array ([ 1 , 2 ]), array ([ 3 , 4 ]), array ([ 5 , 6 ])] If the array has less elements than required, it will adjust from the end accordingly. Example Split the array in 4 parts: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]) newarr = np . array_split ( arr , 4 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ array ([ 1 , 2 ]), array ([ 3 , 4 ]), array ([ 5 ]), array ([ 6 ])] Note: We also have the method split() available but it will not adjust the elements when elements are less in source array for splitting like in example above, array_split() worked properly but split() would fail. Split Into Arrays # The return value of the array_split() method is an array containing each of the split as an array. If you split an array into 3 arrays, you can access them from the result just like any array element: Example Access the splitted arrays: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]) newarr = np . array_split ( arr , 3 ) print ( newarr [ 0 ]) print ( newarr [ 1 ]) print ( newarr [ 2 ]) Output : [ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] [ 5 6 ] Splitting 2-D Arrays # Use the same syntax when splitting 2-D arrays. Use the array_split() method, pass in the array you want to split and the number of splits you want to do. Example Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays. import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ], [ 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 ], [ 9 , 10 ], [ 11 , 12 ]]) newarr = np . array_split ( arr , 3 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ array ([[ 1 , 2 ], [ 3 , 4 ]]), array ([[ 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 ]]), array ([[ 9 , 10 ], [ 11 , 12 ]])] The example above returns three 2-D arrays. Example Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays. [array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), array([[ 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]), array([[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])] Output: [array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), array([[ 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]), array([[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])] The example above returns three 2-D arrays. In addition, you can specify which axis you want to do the split around. The example below also returns three 2-D arrays, but they are split along the row (axis=1). Example Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along rows. import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 10 , 11 , 12 ], [ 13 , 14 , 15 ], [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]]) newarr = np . array_split ( arr , 3 , axis = 1 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ array ([[ 1 ], [ 4 ], [ 7 ], [ 10 ], [ 13 ], [ 16 ]]), array ([[ 2 ], [ 5 ], [ 8 ], [ 11 ], [ 14 ], [ 17 ]]), array ([[ 3 ], [ 6 ], [ 9 ], [ 12 ], [ 15 ], [ 18 ]])] An alternate solution is using hsplit() opposite of hstack() Example Use the hsplit() method to split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along rows. import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 10 , 11 , 12 ], [ 13 , 14 , 15 ], [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]]) newarr = np . hsplit ( arr , 3 ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ array ([[ 1 ], [ 4 ], [ 7 ], [ 10 ], [ 13 ], [ 16 ]]), array ([[ 2 ], [ 5 ], [ 8 ], [ 11 ], [ 14 ], [ 17 ]]), array ([[ 3 ], [ 6 ], [ 9 ], [ 12 ], [ 15 ], [ 18 ]])] Note: Similar alternates to vstack() and dstack() are available as vsplit() and dsplit() . NumPy Searching Arrays # Searching Arrays # You can search an array for a certain value, and return the indexes that get a match. To search an array, use the where() method. Example Find the indexes where the value is 4: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 4 , 4 ]) x = np . where ( arr == 4 ) print ( x ) Output : ( array ([ 3 , 5 , 6 ]),) -> Which means that the value 4 is present at index 3 , 5 , and 6. Example Find the indexes where the values are even: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]) x = np . where ( arr % 2 == 0 ) print ( x ) Output : ( array ([ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ]),) Example Find the indexes where the values are odd: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]) x = np . where ( arr % 2 == 1 ) print ( x ) Output : ( array ([ 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 ]),) Search Sorted # There is a method called searchsorted() which performs a binary search in the array, and returns the index where the specified value would be inserted to maintain the search order. The searchsorted() method is assumed to be used on sorted arrays. Example Find the indexes where the value 7 should be inserted: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]) x = np . searchsorted ( arr , 7 ) print ( x ) Output : 1 -> The number 7 should be inserted on index 1 to remain the sort order . The method starts the search from the left and returns the first index where the number 7 is no longer larger than the next value. Search From the Right Side # By default the left most index is returned, but we can give side='right' to return the right most index instead. Example Find the indexes where the value 7 should be inserted, starting from the right: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]) x = np . searchsorted ( arr , 7 , side = 'right' ) print ( x ) Output : 2 -> The number 7 should be inserted on index 2 to remain the sort order . The method starts the search from the right and returns the first index where the number 7 is no longer less than the next value. Multiple Values # To search for more than one value, use an array with the specified values. Example Find the indexes where the values 2, 4, and 6 should be inserted: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ]) x = np . searchsorted ( arr , [ 2 , 4 , 6 ]) print ( x ) Output : [ 1 2 3 ] arr = [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ] \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 Index : 0 1 2 3 The return value is an array: [1 2 3] containing the three indexes where 2, 4, 6 would be inserted in the original array to maintain the order. NumPy Sorting Arrays # Sorting Arrays # Sorting means putting elements in an ordered sequence. Ordered sequence is any sequence that has an order corresponding to elements, like numeric or alphabetical, ascending or descending. The NumPy ndarray object has a function called sort(), that will sort a specified array. Example Sort the array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 3 , 2 , 0 , 1 ]) print ( np . sort ( arr )) Output : [ 0 1 2 3 ] Note: This method returns a copy of the array, leaving the original array unchanged. Example Sort the array alphabetically: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 'banana' , 'cherry' , 'apple' ]) print ( np . sort ( arr )) Output : [ 'apple' 'banana' 'cherry' ] Example Sort a boolean array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ True , False , True ]) print ( np . sort ( arr )) Output : [ False True True ] Sorting a 2-D Array # If you use the sort() method on a 2-D array, both arrays will be sorted: Example Sort a 2-D array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([[ 3 , 2 , 4 ], [ 5 , 0 , 1 ]]) print ( np . sort ( arr )) Output : [[ 2 3 4 ] [ 0 1 5 ]] NumPy Filter Array # Filtering Arrays # Getting some elements out of an existing array and creating a new array out of them is called filtering. In NumPy, you filter an array using a boolean index list. A boolean index list is a list of booleans corresponding to indexes in the array. If the value at an index is True that element is contained in the filtered array, if the value at that index is False that element is excluded from the filtered array. Example Create an array from the elements on index 0 and 2: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ]) x = [ True , False , True , False ] newarr = arr [ x ] print ( newarr ) Output : [ 41 43 ] The example above will return [ 41 , 43 ], why ? Because the new array contains only the values where the filter array had the value True , in this case , index 0 and 2. Creating the Filter Array # In the example above we hard-coded the True and False values, but the common use is to create a filter array based on conditions. Example Create a filter array that will return only values higher than 42: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ]) # Create an empty list filter_arr = [] # go through each element in arr for element in arr : # if the element is higher than 42, set the value to True, otherwise False: if element > 42 : filter_arr . append ( True ) else : filter_arr . append ( False ) newarr = arr [ filter_arr ] print ( filter_arr ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ False , False , True , True ] [ 43 44 ] Example Create a filter array that will return only even elements from the original array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]) # Create an empty list filter_arr = [] # go through each element in arr for element in arr : # if the element is completely divisble by 2, set the value to True, otherwise False if element % 2 == 0 : filter_arr . append ( True ) else : filter_arr . append ( False ) newarr = arr [ filter_arr ] print ( filter_arr ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ False , True , False , True , False , True , False ] [ 2 4 6 ] Creating Filter Directly From Array # The above example is quite a common task in NumPy and NumPy provides a nice way to tackle it. We can directly substitute the array instead of the iterable variable in our condition and it will work just as we expect it to. Example Create a filter array that will return only values higher than 42: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ]) filter_arr = arr > 42 newarr = arr [ filter_arr ] print ( filter_arr ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ False False True True ] [ 43 44 ] Example Create a filter array that will return only even elements from the original array: import numpy as np arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]) filter_arr = arr % 2 == 0 newarr = arr [ filter_arr ] print ( filter_arr ) print ( newarr ) Output : [ False True False True False True False ] [ 2 4 6 ] \ud83e\udde0 1.

But can a machine also learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here comes the role of Machine Learning. Machine learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms that can then identify patterns and make predictions on new data. Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Why we need Machine Learning? # Machine learning is able to learn, train from data and solve/predict complex solutions which cannot be done with traditional programming. It enables us with better decision making and solve complex business problems in optimized time. Machine learning has applications in various fields, like Healthcare, finance, educations, sports and more. Solving Complex Business Problems: It is too complex to tackle problems like Image recognition, Natural language processing, disease diagnose etc. with Traditional programming. Machine learning can handle such problems by learning from examples or making predictions, rather than following some rigid rules. Handling Large Volumes of Data: Expansion of Internet and users is producing massive amount of data. Machine Learning can process these data effectively and analyze, predict useful insights from them. For example, ML can analyze millions of everyday transactions to detect any fraud activity in real time. Social platforms like Facebook, Instagram use ML to analyze billions of post, like and share to predict next recommendation in your feed. Automate Repetitive Tasks: With Machine Learning, we can automate time-consuming and repetitive tasks, with better accuracy. GMail uses ML to filter out Spam emails and ensure your Index stay clean and spam free. Using traditional programming or handling these manually will only make the system error-prone. Customer Support chatbots can use ML to solve frequent occurring problems like Checking order status, Password reset etc. Big organizations can use ML to process large amount of data (like Invoices etc) to extract historical and current key insights. Personalized User Experience: All social-media, OTT and E-commerce platforms uses Machine learning to recommend better feed based on user preference or interest. Netflix recommends movies and TV shows based on what you\u2019ve watched E-commerce platforms suggesting products you are likely to buy. Self Improvement in Performance: ML models are able to improve themselves based on more data, like user-behavior and feedback. For example, Voice Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) \u2013 Voice assistants continuously improve as they process millions of voice inputs. They adapt to user preferences, understand regional accents better, and handle ambiguous queries more effectively. Search Engines (Google, Bing) \u2013 Search engines analyze user behavior to refine their ranking algorithms. Self-driving Cars \u2013 Self-driving cars use data from millions of miles driven (both in simulations and real-world scenarios) to enhance their decision-making. Introduction to Machine Learning # A subset of artificial intelligence known as machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to independently learn from data and previous experiences. Machine learning algorithms create a mathematical model that, without being explicitly programmed, aids in making predictions or decisions with the assistance of sample historical data, or training data. For the purpose of developing predictive models, machine learning brings together statistics and computer science.

A tool designed to extract and read the content of a specified website. It is capable of handling various types of web pages by making HTTP requests and parsing the received HTML content. This tool can be particularly useful for web scraping tasks, data collection, or extracting specific information from websites. AI Mind Tool: The AIMindTool is designed to query data sources in natural language. The AIMindTool is a wrapper around AI-Minds provided by MindsDB. It allows you to query data sources in natural language by simply configuring their connection parameters. This tool is useful when you need answers to questions from your data stored in various data sources including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, ClickHouse, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery. Minds are AI systems that work similarly to large language models (LLMs) but go beyond by answering any question from any data. Example: from crewai_tools import AIMindTool # Initialize the AIMindTool aimind_tool = AIMindTool ( datasources = [ { \"description\" : \"house sales data\" , \"engine\" : \"postgres\" , \"connection_data\" : { \"user\" : \"demo_user\" , \"password\" : \"demo_password\" , \"host\" : \"samples.mindsdb.com\" , \"port\" : 5432 , \"database\" : \"demo\" , \"schema\" : \"demo_data\" }, \"tables\" : [ \"house_sales\" ] } ] ) # Run a natural language query result = aimind_tool . run ( \"How many 3 bedroom houses were sold in 2008?\" ) print ( result ) Brave Search: The BraveSearchTool is designed to search the internet using the Brave Search API. This tool is designed to perform web searches using the Brave Search API. It allows you to search the internet with a specified query and retrieve relevant results. The tool supports customizable result counts and country-specific searches. Example: from crewai_tools import BraveSearchTool # Initialize the tool for internet searching capabilities tool = BraveSearchTool () # Execute a search results = tool . run ( search_query = \"CrewAI agent framework\" ) print ( results ) Browserbase Web Loader: Browserbase is a developer platform to reliably run, manage, and monitor headless browsers. Example: from crewai_tools import BrowserbaseLoadTool # Initialize the tool with the Browserbase API key and Project ID tool = BrowserbaseLoadTool () Code Docs RAG Search: The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation. The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation. It enables users to efficiently find specific information or topics within code documentation. By providing a docs_url during initialization, the tool narrows down the search to that particular documentation site. Alternatively, without a specific docs_url, it searches across a wide array of code documentation known or discovered throughout its execution, making it versatile for various documentation search needs. Example: from crewai_tools import CodeDocsSearchTool # To search any code documentation content # if the URL is known or discovered during its execution: tool = CodeDocsSearchTool () # OR # To specifically focus your search on a given documentation site # by providing its URL: tool = CodeDocsSearchTool ( docs_url = 'https://docs.example.com/reference' ) Custom model and embeddings: tool = CodeDocsSearchTool ( config = dict ( llm = dict ( provider = \"ollama\" , # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ... config = dict ( model = \"llama2\" , # temperature=0.5, # top_p=1, # stream=true, ), ), embedder = dict ( provider = \"google\" , # or openai, ollama, ... config = dict ( model = \"models/embedding-001\" , task_type = \"retrieval_document\" , # title=\"Embeddings\", ), ), ) ) Code Interpreter: The CodeInterpreterTool is a powerful tool designed for executing Python 3 code within a secure, isolated environment. The CodeInterpreterTool enables CrewAI agents to execute Python 3 code that they generate autonomously. The code is run in a secure, isolated Docker container, ensuring safety regardless of the content. This functionality is particularly valuable as it allows agents to create code, execute it, obtain the results, and utilize that information to inform subsequent decisions and actions. Example: from crewai import Agent , Task , Crew , Process from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool # Initialize the tool code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool () # Define an agent that uses the tool programmer_agent = Agent ( role = \"Python Programmer\" , goal = \"Write and execute Python code to solve problems\" , backstory = \"An expert Python programmer who can write efficient code to solve complex problems.\" , tools = [ code_interpreter ], verbose = True , ) # Example task to generate and execute code coding_task = Task ( description = \"Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number and print the result.\" , expected_output = \"The Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number.\" , agent = programmer_agent , ) # Create and run the crew crew = Crew ( agents = [ programmer_agent ], tasks = [ coding_task ], verbose = True , process = Process . sequential , ) result = crew . kickoff () You can also enable code execution directly when creating an agent: from crewai import Agent # Create an agent with code execution enabled programmer_agent = Agent ( role = \"Python Programmer\" , goal = \"Write and execute Python code to solve problems\" , backstory = \"An expert Python programmer who can write efficient code to solve complex problems.\" , allow_code_execution = True , # This automatically adds the CodeInterpreterTool verbose = True , ) Agent Integration Example: Here\u2019s a more detailed example of how to integrate the CodeInterpreterTool with a CrewAI agent: from crewai import Agent , Task , Crew from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool # Initialize the tool code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool () # Define an agent that uses the tool data_analyst = Agent ( role = \"Data Analyst\" , goal = \"Analyze data using Python code\" , backstory = \"\"\"You are an expert data analyst who specializes in using Python to analyze and visualize data.

Graph API Basics # How to update graph state from nodes # Define state State in LangGraph can be a TypedDict , Pydantic model, or dataclass. State: The first thing you do when you define a graph is define the State of the graph. The State consists of the schema of the graph as well as reducer functions which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the State will be the input schema to all Nodes and Edges in the graph, and can be either a TypedDict or a Pydantic model. All Nodes will emit updates to the State which are then applied using the specified reducer function. Schema: The main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using TypedDict. However, we also support using a Pydantic BaseModel as your graph state to add default values and additional data validation. How to use Pydantic model as graph state # First we need to install the packages required % %capture -- no - stderr %pip install -- quiet - U langgraph import getpass import os def _set_env ( var : str ): if not os . environ . get ( var ): os . environ [ var ] = getpass . getpass ( f \" { var } : \" ) _set_env ( \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" ) Input Validation # from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , END from typing_extensions import TypedDict from pydantic import BaseModel # The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes) class OverallState ( BaseModel ): a : str def node ( state : OverallState ): return { \"a\" : \"goodbye\" } # Build the state graph builder = StateGraph ( OverallState ) builder . add_node ( node ) # node_1 is the first node builder . add_edge ( START , \"node\" ) # Start the graph with node_1 builder . add_edge ( \"node\" , END ) # End the graph after node_1 graph = builder . compile () # Test the graph with a valid input graph . invoke ({ \"a\" : \"hello\" }) Output: {'a': 'goodbye'} Invoke the graph with an invalid input try : graph . invoke ( { \"a\" : 123 } ) # Should be a string except Exception as e : print ( \"An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.\" ) print ( e ) An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string . 1 validation error for OverallState a Input should be a valid string [ type = string_type , input_value = 123 , input_type = int ] For further information visit https :// errors . pydantic . dev / 2.9 / v / string_type Multiple Nodes # Run-time validation will also work in a multi-node graph. In the example below bad_node updates a to an integer.

Serialization Behavior When using Pydantic models as state schemas, it's important to understand how serialization works, especially when: - Passing Pydantic objects as inputs - Receiving outputs from the graph - Working with nested Pydantic models from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , END from pydantic import BaseModel class NestedModel ( BaseModel ): value : str class ComplexState ( BaseModel ): text : str count : int nested : NestedModel def process_node ( state : ComplexState ): # Node receives a validated Pydantic object print ( f \"Input state type: { type ( state ) } \" ) print ( f \"Nested type: { type ( state . nested ) } \" ) # Return a dictionary update return { \"text\" : state . text + \" processed\" , \"count\" : state . count + 1 } # Build the graph builder = StateGraph ( ComplexState ) builder . add_node ( \"process\" , process_node ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"process\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"process\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () # Create a Pydantic instance for input input_state = ComplexState ( text = \"hello\" , count = 0 , nested = NestedModel ( value = \"test\" )) print ( f \"Input object type: { type ( input_state ) } \" ) # Invoke graph with a Pydantic instance result = graph . invoke ( input_state ) print ( f \"Output type: { type ( result ) } \" ) print ( f \"Output content: { result } \" ) # Convert back to Pydantic model if needed output_model = ComplexState ( ** result ) print ( f \"Converted back to Pydantic: { type ( output_model ) } \" ) Runtime Type Coercion Pydantic performs runtime type coercion for certain data types. This can be helpful but also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of it. from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , END from pydantic import BaseModel class CoercionExample ( BaseModel ): # Pydantic will coerce string numbers to integers number : int # Pydantic will parse string booleans to bool flag : bool def inspect_node ( state : CoercionExample ): print ( f \"number: { state . number } (type: { type ( state . number ) } )\" ) print ( f \"flag: { state . flag } (type: { type ( state . flag ) } )\" ) return {} builder = StateGraph ( CoercionExample ) builder . add_node ( \"inspect\" , inspect_node ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"inspect\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"inspect\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () # Demonstrate coercion with string inputs that will be converted result = graph . invoke ({ \"number\" : \"42\" , \"flag\" : \"true\" }) # This would fail with a validation error try : graph . invoke ({ \"number\" : \"not-a-number\" , \"flag\" : \"true\" }) except Exception as e : print ( f \" \\n Expected validation error: { e } \" ) Working with Message Models When working with LangChain message types in your state schema, there are important considerations for serialization. You should use AnyMessage (rather than BaseMessage) for proper serialization/deserialization when using message objects over the wire: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , END from pydantic import BaseModel from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage , AIMessage , AnyMessage from typing import List class ChatState ( BaseModel ): messages : List [ AnyMessage ] context : str def add_message ( state : ChatState ): return { \"messages\" : state . messages + [ AIMessage ( content = \"Hello there!\" )]} builder = StateGraph ( ChatState ) builder . add_node ( \"add_message\" , add_message ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"add_message\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"add_message\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () # Create input with a message initial_state = ChatState ( messages = [ HumanMessage ( content = \"Hi\" )], context = \"Customer support chat\" ) result = graph . invoke ( initial_state ) print ( f \"Output: { result } \" ) # Convert back to Pydantic model to see message types output_model = ChatState ( ** result ) for i , msg in enumerate ( output_model . messages ): print ( f \"Message { i } : { type ( msg ) . __name__ } - { msg . content } \" ) Graphs # At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components: State: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel. Nodes: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State. Edges: Python functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current State. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions. By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' Python code. In short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next. LangGraph's underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. A super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an inactive state. A node becomes active when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or \"channels\"). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to halt by marking themselves as inactive. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are inactive and no messages are in transit. StateGraph: The StateGraph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined State object. Compiling your graph: To build your graph, you first define the state , you then add nodes and edges , and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed? Compiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like checkpointers and breakpoints . You compile your graph by just calling the .compile method: graph = graph_builder.compile(...) Note: You MUST compile your graph before you can use it. Multiple schemas Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this: Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output. We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key. It is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, PrivateState . Let's look at an example: class InputState ( TypedDict ): user_input: str class OutputState ( TypedDict ): graph_output: str class OverallState ( TypedDict ): foo: str user_input: str graph_output: str class PrivateState ( TypedDict ): bar: str def node_1 ( state: InputState ) -> OverallState: # Write to OverallState return { \"foo\" : state [ \"user_input\" ] + \" name\" } def node_2 ( state: OverallState ) -> PrivateState: # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState return { \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + \" is\" } def node_3 ( state: PrivateState ) -> OutputState: # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState return { \"graph_output\" : state [ \"bar\" ] + \" Lance\" } builder = StateGraph ( OverallState , input = InputState , output = OutputState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , node_2 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_3\" , node_3 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_2\" , \"node_3\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_3\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () graph . invoke ({ \"user_input\" : \"My\" }) { 'graph_output' : 'My name is Lance' } There are two subtle and important points to note here: We pass state: InputState as the input schema to node_1. But, we write out to foo, a channel in OverallState. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node can write to any state channel in the graph state. The graph state is the union of of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes OverallState and the filters InputState and OutputState. We initialize the graph with StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState). So, how can we write to PrivateState in node_2? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the StateGraph initialization? We can do this because nodes can also declare additional state channels as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the PrivateState schema is defined, so we can add bar as a new state channel in the graph and write to it. Reducers # Reducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the State. Each key in the State has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer: Default Reducer These two examples show how to use the default reducer: Example A: from typing_extensions import TypedDict class State ( TypedDict ): foo : int bar : list [ str ] In this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let's assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]} Example B: from typing import Annotated from typing_extensions import TypedDict from operator import add class State ( TypedDict ): foo : int bar : Annotated [ list [ str ], add ] In this example, we've used the Annotated type to specify a reducer function (operator.add) for the second key (bar). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let's assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}. Notice here that the bar key is updated by adding the two lists together. Working with Messages in Graph State # Why use messages? Most modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's ChatModel in particular accepts a list of Message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as HumanMessage (user input) or AIMessage (LLM response). To read more about what message objects are, please refer to this conceptual guide. Using Messages in your Graph In many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of Message objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see messages key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of Message objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use operator.add as a reducer. However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use operator.add, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt add_messages function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly. Serialization In addition to keeping track of message IDs, the add_messages function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain Message objects whenever a state update is received on the messages channel. See more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization here. This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format: # this is supported { \"messages\" : [ HumanMessage ( content = \"message\" )]} # and this is also supported { \"messages\" : [{ \"type\" : \"human\" , \"content\" : \"message\" }]} Since the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain Messages when using add_messages, you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like state[\"messages\"][-1].content. Below is an example of a graph that uses add_messages as it's reducer function. from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages from typing import Annotated from typing_extensions import TypedDict class GraphState ( TypedDict ): messages : Annotated [ list [ AnyMessage ], add_messages ] MessagesState Since having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called MessagesState which makes it easy to use messages. MessagesState is defined with a single messages key which is a list of AnyMessage objects and uses the add_messages reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like: from langgraph.graph import MessagesState class State ( MessagesState ): documents : list [ str ] Nodes # In LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions (sync or async) where the first positional argument is the state, and (optionally), the second positional argument is a \"config\", containing optional configurable parameters (such as a thread_id). Similar to NetworkX, you add these nodes to a graph using the add_node method: from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.graph import StateGraph builder = StateGraph ( dict ) def my_node ( state : dict , config : RunnableConfig ): print ( \"In node: \" , config [ \"configurable\" ][ \"user_id\" ]) return { \"results\" : f \"Hello, { state [ 'input' ] } !\" } # The second argument is optional def my_other_node ( state : dict ): return state builder . add_node ( \"my_node\" , my_node ) builder . add_node ( \"other_node\" , my_other_node ) ... Behind the scenes, functions are converted to RunnableLambdas, which add batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging. If you add a node to a graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default name equivalent to the function name. builder.add_node(my_node) # You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `\"my_node\"` START Node # The START Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first. from langgraph.graph import START graph . add_edge ( START , \"node_a\" ) END Node # The END Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done. from langgraph.graph import END graph . add_edge ( \"node_a\" , END ) Edges # Edges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges: Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next. Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next. Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives. Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives. A node can have MULTIPLE outgoing edges. If a node has multiple out-going edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep. Normal Edges: If you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly. graph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\") Conditional Edges: If you want to optionally route to 1 or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed: graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function) Similar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value. By default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep. You can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function's output to the name of the next node. graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"}) Note: Use Command instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function. Command It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions: def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : return Command ( # state update update = { \"foo\" : \"bar\" }, # control flow goto = \"my_other_node\" ) With Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges): def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : if state [ \"foo\" ] == \"bar\" : return Command ( update = { \"foo\" : \"baz\" }, goto = \"my_other_node\" ) Important When returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that my_node can navigate to my_other_node. When should I use Command instead of conditional edges? # Use Command when you need to both update the graph state and route to a different node. For example, when implementing multi-agent handoffs where it's important to route to a different agent and pass some information to that agent. Use conditional edges to route between nodes conditionally without updating the state. Navigating to a node in a parent graph # If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command: def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"other_subgraph\" ]] : return Command ( update = { \"foo\" : \"bar\" } , goto = \"other_subgraph\" , # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph graph = Command . PARENT ) Note: Setting graph to Command.PARENT will navigate to the closest parent graph. State updates with Command.PARENT When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this example. Using inside tools # A common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={\"my_custom_key\": \"foo\", \"messages\": [...]}) from the tool: @ tool def lookup_user_info ( tool_call_id : Annotated [ str , InjectedToolCallId ], config : RunnableConfig ): \"\"\"Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions.\"\"\" user_info = get_user_info ( config . get ( \"configurable\" , {}) . get ( \"user_id\" )) return Command ( update = { # update the state keys \"user_info\" : user_info , # update the message history \"messages\" : [ ToolMessage ( \"Successfully looked up user information\" , tool_call_id = tool_call_id )] } ) Human-in-the-loop # Command is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using interrupt() to collect user input, Command is then used to supply the input and resume execution via Command(resume=\"User input\"). Check out this conceptual guide for more information. Persistence # LangGraph provides built-in persistence for your agent's state using checkpointers. Checkpointers save snapshots of the graph state at every superstep, allowing resumption at any time. This enables features like human-in-the-loop interactions, memory management, and fault-tolerance. You can even directly manipulate a graph's state after its execution using the appropriate get and update methods. For more details, see the persistence conceptual guide. Threads # Threads in LangGraph represent individual sessions or conversations between your graph and a user. When using checkpointing, turns in a single conversation (and even steps within a single graph execution) are organized by a unique thread ID. Storage # LangGraph provides built-in document storage through the BaseStore interface. Unlike checkpointers, which save state by thread ID, stores use custom namespaces for organizing data. This enables cross-thread persistence, allowing agents to maintain long-term memories, learn from past interactions, and accumulate knowledge over time. Common use cases include storing user profiles, building knowledge bases, and managing global preferences across all threads. Graph Migrations # LangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state. For threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc) For threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution. For modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys State keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads State keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution. Configuration # When creating a graph, you can also mark that certain parts of the graph are configurable. This is commonly done to enable easily switching between models or system prompts. This allows you to create a single \"cognitive architecture\" (the graph) but have multiple different instance of it. You can optionally specify a config_schema when creating a graph. class ConfigSchema ( TypedDict ): llm: str graph = StateGraph ( State , config_schema = ConfigSchema ) You can then pass this configuration into the graph using the configurable config field. config = {\"configurable\": {\"llm\": \"anthropic\"}} graph.invoke(inputs, config=config) You can then access and use this configuration inside a node: def node_a ( state , config ): llm_type = config . get ( \"configurable\" , {}). get ( \"llm\" , \"openai\" ) llm = get_llm ( llm_type ) ... Recursion Limit # The recursion limit sets the maximum number of super-steps the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise GraphRecursionError. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to .invoke/.stream via the config dictionary. Importantly, recursion_limit is a standalone config key and should not be passed inside the configurable key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below: graph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\": 5, \"configurable\":{\"llm\": \"anthropic\"}}) interrupt # Use the interrupt function to pause the graph at specific points to collect user input. The interrupt function surfaces interrupt information to the client, allowing the developer to collect user input, validate the graph state, or make decisions before resuming execution. from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_approval_node ( state : State ): ... answer = interrupt ( # This value will be sent to the client. # It can be any JSON serializable value. { \"question\" : \"is it ok to continue?\" }, ) ... Resuming the graph is done by passing a Command object to the graph with the resume key set to the value returned by the interrupt function. Breakpoints # Breakpoints pause graph execution at specific points and enable stepping through execution step by step. Breakpoints are powered by LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the state after each graph step. Breakpoints can also be used to enable human-in-the-loop workflows, though we recommend using the interrupt function for this purpose. Read more about breakpoints in the Breakpoints conceptual guide. Subgraphs # A subgraph is a graph that is used as a node in another graph. This is nothing more than the age-old concept of encapsulation, applied to LangGraph. Some reasons for using subgraphs are: building multi-agent systems when you want to reuse a set of nodes in multiple graphs, which maybe share some state, you can define them once in a subgraph and then use them in multiple parent graphs when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph There are two ways to add subgraphs to a parent graph: add a node with the compiled subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph share state keys and you don't need to transform state on the way in or out builder.add_node(\"subgraph\", subgraph_builder.compile()) add a node with a function that invokes the subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state before or after calling the subgraph subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile() def call_subgraph(state: State): return subgraph.invoke({\"subgraph_key\": state[\"parent_key\"]}) builder.add_node(\"subgraph\", call_subgraph) As a compiled graph # The simplest way to create subgraph nodes is by using a compiled subgraph directly. When doing so, it is important that the parent graph and the subgraph state schemas share at least one key which they can use to communicate. If your graph and subgraph do not share any keys, you should write a function invoking the subgraph instead. Note: If you pass extra keys to the subgraph node (i.e., in addition to the shared keys), they will be ignored by the subgraph node. Similarly, if you return extra keys from the subgraph, they will be ignored by the parent graph. from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from typing import TypedDict class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): foo : str # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state bar : str # Define subgraph def subgraph_node ( state : SubgraphState ): # note that this subgraph node can communicate with the parent graph via the shared \"foo\" key return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + \"bar\" } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node ) ... subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"subgraph\" , subgraph ) ... graph = builder . compile () As a function # You might want to define a subgraph with a completely different schema. In this case, you can create a node function that invokes the subgraph. This function will need to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node. class State ( TypedDict ) : foo : str class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ) : # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state bar : str baz : str # Define subgraph def subgraph_node ( state : SubgraphState ) : return { \"bar\" : state [ \"bar\" ] + \"baz\" } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node ) ... subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph def node ( state : State ) : # transform the state to the subgraph state response = subgraph . invoke ( { \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ]} ) # transform response back to the parent state return { \"foo\" : response [ \"bar\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) # note that we are using `node` function instead of a compiled subgraph builder . add_node ( node ) ... graph = builder . compile () Visualization # It's often nice to be able to visualize graphs, especially as they get more complex. LangGraph comes with several built-in ways to visualize graphs. visualize Streaming # LangGraph is built with first class support for streaming, including streaming updates from graph nodes during the execution, streaming tokens from LLM calls and more. See this conceptual guide for more information. streaming How to create branches for parallel node execution\u00b6 # Parallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and conditional_edges. Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you. How to run graph nodes in parallel # In this example, we fan out from Node A to B and C and then fan in to D. With our state, we specify the reducer add operation. This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See this guide for more detail on updating state with reducers. import operator from typing import Annotated , Any from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , END class State ( TypedDict ): # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only aggregate : Annotated [ list , operator . add ] def a ( state : State ): print ( f 'Adding \"A\" to { state [ \"aggregate\" ] } ' ) return { \"aggregate\" : [ \"A\" ]} def b ( state : State ): print ( f 'Adding \"B\" to { state [ \"aggregate\" ] } ' ) return { \"aggregate\" : [ \"B\" ]} def c ( state : State ): print ( f 'Adding \"C\" to { state [ \"aggregate\" ] } ' ) return { \"aggregate\" : [ \"C\" ]} def d ( state : State ): print ( f 'Adding \"D\" to { state [ \"aggregate\" ] } ' ) return { \"aggregate\" : [ \"D\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( a ) builder . add_node ( b ) builder . add_node ( c ) builder . add_node ( d ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"a\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"a\" , \"b\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"a\" , \"c\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"b\" , \"d\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"c\" , \"d\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"d\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () from IPython.display import Image , display display ( Image ( graph . get_graph () . draw_mermaid_png ())) With the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated. graph . invoke ({ \"aggregate\" : []}, { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"foo\" }}) Adding \"A\" to [] Adding \"B\" to ['A'] Adding \"C\" to ['A'] Adding \"D\" to ['A', 'B', 'C'] Note: In the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. Because they are in the same step, node \"d\" executes after both \"b\" and \"c\" are finished. Importantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them. Parallel node fan-out and fan-in with extra steps # The above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one path had more than one step? Let's add a node b_2 in the \"b\" branch: def b_2 ( state: State ) : print ( f ' Adding \"B_2\" to { state [ \"aggregate\" ]}') return { \"aggregate\" : [ \"B_2\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( a ) builder . add_node ( b ) builder . add_node ( b_2 ) builder . add_node ( c ) builder . add_node ( d ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"a\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"a\" , \"b\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"a\" , \"c\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"b\" , \"b_2\" ) builder . add_edge ([ \"b_2\" , \"c\" ], \"d\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"d\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () from IPython.display import Image , display display ( Image ( graph . get_graph () . draw_mermaid_png ())) graph . invoke ({ \"aggregate\" : []}) Adding \"A\" to [] Adding \"B\" to ['A'] Adding \"C\" to ['A'] Adding \"B_2\" to ['A', 'B', 'C'] Adding \"D\" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2'] {' aggregate ' : [ 'A' , 'B' , 'C' , ' B_2 ', 'D' ]} Note: In the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. What happens in the next step? We use add_edge([\"b_2\", \"c\"], \"d\") here to force node \"d\" to only run when both nodes \"b_2\" and \"c\" have finished execution. If we added two separate edges, node \"d\" would run twice: after node b2 finishes and once again after node c (in whichever order those nodes finish).

This approach involves breaking a task into smaller sub-tasks, processing each sub-task in parallel, and aggregating the results across all of the completed sub-tasks. Consider this example: given a general topic from the user, generate a list of related subjects, generate a joke for each subject, and select the best joke from the resulting list. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects (e.g., related subjects) and we want to apply some other node (e.g., generate a joke) to all those objects (e.g., subjects). However, two main challenges arise. (1) the number of objects (e.g., subjects) may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) when we lay out the graph and (2) the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object). LangGraph addresses these challenges through its Send API. By utilizing conditional edges, Send can distribute different states (e.g., subjects) to multiple instances of a node (e.g., joke generation). Importantly, the sent state can differ from the core graph's state, allowing for flexible and dynamic workflow management.

This is most commonly done by adding a conditional edge that routes to the END node once we reach some termination condition. You can also set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of supersteps that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits here. Let's consider a simple graph with a loop to better understand how these mechanisms work. Summary # When creating a loop, you can include a conditional edge that specifies a termination condition: builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( a ) builder . add_node ( b ) def route ( state : State ) -> Literal [ \"b\" , END ]: if termination_condition ( state ): return END else : return \"a\" builder . add_edge ( START , \"a\" ) builder . add_conditional_edges ( \"a\" , route ) builder . add_edge ( \"b\" , \"a\" ) graph = builder . compile () To control the recursion limit, specify \"recursion_limit\" in the config. This will raise a GraphRecursionError, which you can catch and handle: from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError try : graph . invoke ( inputs , { \"recursion_limit\" : 3 }) except GraphRecursionError : print ( \"Recursion Error\" ) Define the graph # Let's define a graph with a simple loop.

In our route conditional edge, we specify that we should end after the \"aggregate\" list in the state passes a threshold length. Invoking the graph, we see that we alternate between nodes \"a\" and \"b\" before terminating once we reach the termination condition. graph . invoke ({ \"aggregate\" : []}) Node A sees [] Node B sees ['A'] Node A sees ['A', 'B'] Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A'] Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B'] Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'] Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'] {' aggregate ' : [ 'A' , 'B' , 'A' , 'B' , 'A' , 'B' , 'A' ]} Impose a recursion limit # In some applications, we may not have a guarantee that we will reach a given termination condition.

For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions: def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : return Command ( # state update update = { \"foo\" : \"bar\" }, # control flow goto = \"my_other_node\" ) If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command: def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : return Command ( update = { \"foo\" : \"bar\" } , goto = \"other_subgraph\" , # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph graph = Command .

The retry parameter takes in a RetryPolicy named tuple object. Below we instantiate a RetryPolicy object with the default parameters: from langgraph.pregel import RetryPolicy RetryPolicy () RetryPolicy(initial_interval=0.5, backoff_factor=2.0, max_interval=128.0, max_attempts=3, jitter=True, retry_on=<function default_retry_on at 0x78b964b89940>) By default, the retry_on parameter uses the default_retry_on function, which retries on any exception except for the following: ValueError TypeError ArithmeticError ImportError LookupError NameError SyntaxError RuntimeError ReferenceError StopIteration StopAsyncIteration OSError In addition, for exceptions from popular http request libraries such as requests and httpx it only retries on 5xx status codes. Passing a retry policy to a node # Lastly, we can pass RetryPolicy objects when we call the add_node function.

Without returning state # We are going to define a dummy graph in this example that will always hit the recursion limit.

It will keep track of number of steps until reaching the recursion limit. We can then check the value of remaining_steps to determine whether we should terminate the graph execution and return the state to the user without causing the RecursionError. To do so, we will use a special RemainingSteps annotation. Under the hood, it creates a special ManagedValue channel -- a state channel that will exist for the duration of our graph run and no longer. Since our action node is going to always induce at least 2 extra steps to our graph (since the action node ALWAYS calls the decision node afterwards), we will use this channel to check if we are within 2 steps of the limit. Now, when we run our graph we should receive no errors and instead get the last value of the state before the recursion limit was hit. from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from typing import Annotated from langgraph.managed.is_last_step import RemainingSteps class State ( TypedDict ): value : str action_result : str remaining_steps : RemainingSteps def router ( state : State ): # Force the agent to end if state [ \"remaining_steps\" ] <= 2 : return END if state [ \"value\" ] == \"end\" : return END else : return \"action\" def decision_node ( state ): return { \"value\" : \"keep going!\" } def action_node ( state : State ): # Do your action here ... return { \"action_result\" : \"what a great result!\" } workflow = StateGraph ( State ) workflow . add_node ( \"decision\" , decision_node ) workflow . add_node ( \"action\" , action_node ) workflow . add_edge ( START , \"decision\" ) workflow . add_conditional_edges ( \"decision\" , router , [ \"action\" , END ]) workflow . add_edge ( \"action\" , \"decision\" ) app = workflow . compile () app.invoke({\"value\": \"hi!\"}) {'value': 'keep going!', 'action_result': 'what a great result!'} Persistence # LangGraph Persistence makes it easy to persist state across graph runs (per-thread persistence) and across threads (cross-thread persistence).

How to add thread-level persistence to a subgraph # % %capture -- no - stderr %pip install - U langgraph Define the graph with persistence # To add persistence to a graph with subgraphs, all you need to do is pass a checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. Note: You shouldn't provide a checkpointer when compiling a subgraph. Instead, you must define a single checkpointer that you pass to parent_graph.compile(), and LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. If you pass the checkpointer to the subgraph.compile(), it will simply be ignored. This also applies when you add a node function that invokes the subgraph. Let's define a simple graph with a single subgraph node to show how to do this. from langgraph.graph import START , StateGraph from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from typing import TypedDict # subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): foo : str # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state bar : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"bar\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo') return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # parent graph class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : State ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) # note that we're adding the compiled subgraph as a node to the parent graph builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) We can now compile the graph with an in-memory checkpointer (MemorySaver). checkpointer = MemorySaver() # You must only pass checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. # LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer) Verify persistence works # Let's now run the graph and inspect the persisted state for both the parent graph and the subgraph to verify that persistence works. We should expect to see the final execution results for both the parent and subgraph in state.values. config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}} for _, chunk in graph.stream({\"foo\": \"foo\"}, config, subgraphs=True): print(chunk) {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}} {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}} {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}} {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}} We can now view the parent graph state by calling graph.get_state() with the same config that we used to invoke the graph. graph.get_state(config).values {'foo': 'hi! foobar'} To view the subgraph state, we need to do two things: Find the most recent config value for the subgraph Use graph.get_state() to retrieve that value for the most recent subgraph config. To find the correct config, we can examine the state history from the parent graph and find the state snapshot before we return results from node_2 (the node with subgraph): state_with_subgraph = [ s for s in graph.get_state_history(config) if s.next == (\"node_2\",) ][0] The state snapshot will include the list of tasks to be executed next. When using subgraphs, the tasks will contain the config that we can use to retrieve the subgraph state: subgraph_config = state_with_subgraph.tasks[0].state subgraph_config {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': 'node_2:6ef111a6-f290-7376-0dfc-a4152307bc5b'}} graph.get_state(subgraph_config).values {'foo': 'hi! foobar', 'bar': 'bar'} How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph # In the previous guide you learned how to persist graph state across multiple interactions on a single thread. LangGraph also allows you to persist data across multiple threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared memory and reuse them in the new conversational threads. In this guide, we will show how to construct and use a graph that has a shared memory implemented using the Store interface. % %capture -- no - stderr %pip install - U langchain_openai langgraph import getpass import os def _set_env ( var : str ): if not os . environ . get ( var ): os . environ [ var ] = getpass . getpass ( f \" { var } : \" ) _set_env ( \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" ) _set_env ( \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" ) Define store # In this example we will create a graph that will be able to retrieve information about a user's preferences. We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data. We will then pass the store object when compiling the graph. This allows each node in the graph to access the store: when you define node functions, you can define store keyword argument, and LangGraph will automatically pass the store object you compiled the graph with. When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things: the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories) the object key (similar to filenames) In our example, we'll be using (\"memories\", ) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory. Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function.

How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence # When creating LangGraph agents, you can also set them up so that they persist their state.

This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions . This reference implementation shows how to use MongoDB as the backend for persisting checkpoint state using the langgraph - checkpoint - mongodb library . For demonstration purposes we add persistence to a prebuilt ReAct agent . In general , you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this : from langgraph.graph import StateGraph builder = StateGraph(...) ... define the graph # checkpointer = # mongodb checkpointer (see examples below) graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer) ... ## Setup To use the MongoDB checkpointer , you will need a MongoDB cluster . Follow this guide to create a cluster if you don ' t already have one . Next , let ' s install the required packages and set our API keys %%capture --no-stderr %pip install -U pymongo langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb import getpass import os def _set_env(var: str): if not os.environ.get(var): os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"{var}: \") _set_env(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") OPENAI_API_KEY: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ## Define model and tools for the graph from typing import Literal from langchain_core.tools import tool from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent @tool def get_weather(city: Literal[\"nyc\", \"sf\"]): \"\"\"Use this to get weather information.\"\"\" if city == \"nyc\": return \"It might be cloudy in nyc\" elif city == \"sf\": return \"It's always sunny in sf\" else: raise AssertionError(\"Unknown city\") tools = [get_weather] model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0) ## MongoDB checkpointer usage ## With a connection string This creates a connection to MongoDB directly using the connection string of your cluster .

# await async_mongodb_client.close() ## How to create a custom checkpointer using Redis When creating LangGraph agents , you can also set them up so that they persist their state . This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions . This reference implementation shows how to use Redis as the backend for persisting checkpoint state . Make sure that you have Redis running on port 6379 for going through this guide . For demonstration purposes we add persistence to the pre - built create react agent . In general , you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this : from langgraph.graph import StateGraph builder = StateGraph(....) ... define the graph # checkpointer = # redis checkpointer (see examples below) graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer) ... ## Setup First , let ' s install the required packages and set our API keys %%capture --no-stderr %pip install -U redis langgraph langchain_openai import getpass import os def _set_env(var: str): if not os.environ.get(var): os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"{var}: \") _set_env(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ## Checkpointer implementation ## Define imports and helper functions First , let ' s define some imports and shared utilities for both RedisSaver and AsyncRedisSaver \"\"\"Implementation of a langgraph checkpoint saver using Redis.\"\"\" from contextlib import asynccontextmanager, contextmanager from typing import ( Any, AsyncGenerator, AsyncIterator, Iterator, List, Optional, Tuple, ) from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.checkpoint.base import ( WRITES_IDX_MAP, BaseCheckpointSaver, ChannelVersions, Checkpoint, CheckpointMetadata, CheckpointTuple, PendingWrite, get_checkpoint_id, ) from langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base import SerializerProtocol from redis import Redis from redis.asyncio import Redis as AsyncRedis REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR = \"$\" Utilities shared by both RedisSaver and AsyncRedisSaver # def _make_redis_checkpoint_key( thread_id: str, checkpoint_ns: str, checkpoint_id: str ) -> str: return REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR.join( [\"checkpoint\", thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id] ) def _make_redis_checkpoint_writes_key( thread_id: str, checkpoint_ns: str, checkpoint_id: str, task_id: str, idx: Optional[int], ) -> str: if idx is None: return REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR.join( [\"writes\", thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id, task_id] ) return REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR.join( [\"writes\", thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id, task_id, str(idx)] ) def _parse_redis_checkpoint_key(redis_key: str) -> dict: namespace, thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id = redis_key.split( REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR ) if namespace != \"checkpoint\": raise ValueError(\"Expected checkpoint key to start with 'checkpoint'\") return { \"thread_id\": thread_id, \"checkpoint_ns\": checkpoint_ns, \"checkpoint_id\": checkpoint_id, } def _parse_redis_checkpoint_writes_key(redis_key: str) -> dict: namespace, thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id, task_id, idx = redis_key.split( REDIS_KEY_SEPARATOR ) if namespace != \"writes\": raise ValueError(\"Expected checkpoint key to start with 'checkpoint'\") return { \"thread_id\": thread_id, \"checkpoint_ns\": checkpoint_ns, \"checkpoint_id\": checkpoint_id, \"task_id\": task_id, \"idx\": idx, } def _filter_keys( keys: List[str], before: Optional[RunnableConfig], limit: Optional[int] ) -> list: \"\"\"Filter and sort Redis keys based on optional criteria.\"\"\" if before: keys = [ k for k in keys if _parse_redis_checkpoint_key(k.decode())[\"checkpoint_id\"] < before[\"configurable\"][\"checkpoint_id\"] ] keys = sorted( keys, key=lambda k: _parse_redis_checkpoint_key(k.decode())[\"checkpoint_id\"], reverse=True, ) if limit: keys = keys[:limit] return keys def load_writes( serde: SerializerProtocol, task_id_to_data: dict[tuple[str, str], dict] ) -> list[PendingWrite]: \"\"\"Deserialize pending writes.\"\"\" writes = [ ( task_id, data[b\"channel\"].decode(), serde.loads_typed((data[b\"type\"].decode(), data[b\"value\"])), ) for (task_id, ), data in task_id_to_data.items() ] return writes def _parse_redis_checkpoint_data( serde: SerializerProtocol, key: str, data: dict, pending_writes: Optional[List[PendingWrite]] = None, ) -> Optional[CheckpointTuple]: \"\"\"Parse checkpoint data retrieved from Redis.\"\"\" if not data: return None parsed_key = _parse_redis_checkpoint_key ( key ) thread_id = parsed_key [ \"thread_id\" ] checkpoint_ns = parsed_key [ \"checkpoint_ns\" ] checkpoint_id = parsed_key [ \"checkpoint_id\" ] config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : thread_id , \"checkpoint_ns\" : checkpoint_ns , \"checkpoint_id\" : checkpoint_id , } } checkpoint = serde . loads_typed (( data [ b \"type\" ] . decode (), data [ b \"checkpoint\" ])) metadata = serde . loads ( data [ b \"metadata\" ] . decode ()) parent_checkpoint_id = data . get ( b \"parent_checkpoint_id\" , b \"\" ) . decode () parent_config = ( { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : thread_id , \"checkpoint_ns\" : checkpoint_ns , \"checkpoint_id\" : parent_checkpoint_id , } } if parent_checkpoint_id else None ) return CheckpointTuple ( config = config , checkpoint = checkpoint , metadata = metadata , parent_config = parent_config , pending_writes = pending_writes , ) ## RedisSaver Below is an implementation of RedisSaver ( for synchronous use of graph , i . e . . invoke (), . stream ()).

context across multiple interactions on the same thread (e.g., multiple turns of a conversation). In LangGraph functional API, this kind of memory can be added to any entrypoint() workflow using thread-level persistence. When creating a LangGraph workflow, you can set it up to persist its results by using a checkpointer: Create an instance of a checkpointer: from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver checkpointer = MemorySaver () Pass checkpointer instance to the entrypoint() decorator: from langgraph.func import entrypoint @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs ) ... Optionally expose previous parameter in the workflow function signature: @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs , * , # you can optionally specify `previous` in the workflow function signature # to access the return value from the workflow as of the last execution previous ) : previous = previous or [] combined_inputs = previous + inputs result = do_something ( combined_inputs ) ... Optionally choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as previous: @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs , * , previous ) : ... result = do_something (...) return entrypoint . final ( value = result , save = combine ( inputs , result )) Setup # First we need to install the packages required % %capture -- no - stderr %pip install -- quiet - U langgraph langchain_anthropic Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use). import getpass import os def _set_env ( var : str ): if not os . environ . get ( var ): os . environ [ var ] = getpass . getpass ( f \" { var } : \" ) _set_env ( \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" ) Example: simple chatbot with short-term memory # We will be using a workflow with a single task that calls a chat model.

How to add cross-thread persistence (functional API) # LangGraph allows you to persist data across different threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared (cross-thread) memory and reuse them in the new threads (e.g., new conversations). When using the functional API, you can set it up to store and retrieve memories by using the Store interface: Create an instance of a Store from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore , BaseStore store = InMemoryStore () Pass the store instance to the entrypoint() decorator and expose store parameter in the function signature: from langgraph.func import entrypoint @entrypoint ( store = store ) def workflow ( inputs : dict , store : BaseStore ): my_task ( inputs ) . result () ...

We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data. When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things: the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories) the object key (similar to filenames) In our example, we'll be using (\"memories\", ) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory. Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function. Let's first define our store! from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings in_memory_store = InMemoryStore ( index = { \"embed\" : OpenAIEmbeddings ( model = \"text-embedding-3-small\" ), \"dims\" : 1536 , } ) Create workflow # import uuid from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage from langgraph.func import entrypoint , task from langgraph.graph import add_messages from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore model = ChatAnthropic ( model = \"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" ) @task def call_model ( messages : list [ BaseMessage ], memory_store : BaseStore , user_id : str ): namespace = ( \"memories\" , user_id ) last_message = messages [ - 1 ] memories = memory_store . search ( namespace , query = str ( last_message . content )) info = \" \\n \" . join ([ d . value [ \"data\" ] for d in memories ]) system_msg = f \"You are a helpful assistant talking to the user.

How to manage conversation history # One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to properly manage the conversation history. Note: this guide focuses on how to do this in LangGraph, where you can fully customize how this is done.

How to delete messages # One of the common states for a graph is a list of messages. Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the RemoveMessage modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that. The key idea is that each state key has a reducer key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default MessagesState has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these RemoveMessage modifiers. That reducer then uses these RemoveMessage to delete messages from the key. So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this RemoveMessage modifier will work. You also have to have a reducer defined that knows how to work with this. NOTE: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a user message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.

This message list may actually not be - this is because it currently starts with an AI message , which some models do not allow . # How to add summary of the conversation history One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history . This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations . As conversations get longer and longer , however , this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window . This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM , and potentially ones that error . One way to work around that is to create a summary of the conversation to date , and use that with the past N messages . This guide will go through an example of how to do that . This will involve a few steps : - Check if the conversation is too long ( can be done by checking number of messages or length of messages ) - If yes , the create summary ( will need a prompt for this ) - Then remove all except the last N messages ## Build the chatbot from typing import Literal from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, RemoveMessage, HumanMessage from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END memory = MemorySaver() We will add a summary attribute (in addition to messages key, # which MessagesState already has) # class State(MessagesState): summary: str We will use this model for both the conversation and the summarization # model = ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\") Define the logic to call the model # def call_model(state: State): # If a summary exists, we add this in as a system message summary = state.get(\"summary\", \"\") if summary: system_message = f\"Summary of conversation earlier: {summary}\" messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_message)] + state[\"messages\"] else: messages = state[\"messages\"] response = model.invoke(messages) # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list return {\"messages\": [response]} We now define the logic for determining whether to end or summarize the conversation # def should_continue(state: State) -> Literal[\"summarize_conversation\", END]: \"\"\"Return the next node to execute.\"\"\" messages = state[\"messages\"] # If there are more than six messages, then we summarize the conversation if len(messages) > 6: return \"summarize_conversation\" # Otherwise we can just end return END def summarize_conversation(state: State): # First, we summarize the conversation summary = state.get(\"summary\", \"\") if summary: # If a summary already exists, we use a different system prompt # to summarize it than if one didn't summary_message = ( f\"This is summary of the conversation to date: {summary}\\n\\n\" \"Extend the summary by taking into account the new messages above:\" ) else: summary_message = \"Create a summary of the conversation above:\" messages = state [ \"messages\" ] + [ HumanMessage ( content = summary_message )] response = model . invoke ( messages ) # We now need to delete messages that we no longer want to show up # I will delete all but the last two messages , but you can change this delete_messages = [ RemoveMessage ( id = m . id ) for m in state [ \"messages\" ][ :- 2 ]] return { \"summary\" : response . content , \"messages\" : delete_messages } Define a new graph # workflow = StateGraph(State) Define the conversation node and the summarize node # workflow.add_node(\"conversation\", call_model) workflow.add_node(summarize_conversation) Set the entrypoint as conversation # workflow.add_edge(START, \"conversation\") We now add a conditional edge # workflow.add_conditional_edges( # First, we define the start node.

It is designed to work well out - of - box with LangGraph 's prebuilt ReAct agent, but can also work with any StateGraph as long as its state has a messages key with an appropriate reducer (see MessagesState). ## Define tools from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode @tool def get_weather(location: str): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location.lower() in [\"sf\", \"san francisco\"]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else: return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" @tool def get_coolest_cities(): \"\"\"Get a list of coolest cities\"\"\" return \"nyc, sf\" tools = [get_weather, get_coolest_cities] tool_node = ToolNode(tools) ## Manually call ToolNode ToolNode operates on graph state with a list of messages . It expects the last message in the list to be an AIMessage with tool_calls parameter . Let 's first see how to invoke the tool node manually: message_with_single_tool_call = AIMessage( content=\"\", tool_calls=[ { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"args\": {\"location\": \"sf\"}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", } ], ) tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [message_with_single_tool_call]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id')]} Note that typically you don 't need to create AIMessage manually, and it will be automatically generated by any LangChain chat model that supports tool calling. You can also do parallel tool calling using ToolNode if you pass multiple tool calls to AIMessage 's tool_calls parameter: message_with_multiple_tool_calls = AIMessage( content=\"\", tool_calls=[ { \"name\": \"get_coolest_cities\", \"args\": {}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id_1\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", }, { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"args\": {\"location\": \"sf\"}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id_2\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", }, ], ) tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [message_with_multiple_tool_calls]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content='nyc, sf', name='get_coolest_cities', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_1'), ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_2')]} ## Using with chat models We 'll be using a small chat model from Anthropic in our example. To use chat models with tool calling, we need to first ensure that the model is aware of the available tools. We do this by calling .bind_tools method on ChatAnthropic model from typing import Literal from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode model_with_tools = ChatAnthropic( model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\", temperature=0 ).bind_tools(tools) model_with_tools.invoke(\"what's the weather in sf?\").tool_calls [{'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'toolu_01Fwm7dg1mcJU43Fkx2pqgm8', 'type': 'tool_call'}] As you can see , the AI message generated by the chat model already has tool_calls populated , so we can just pass it directly to ToolNode tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [model_with_tools.invoke(\"what's the weather in sf?\")]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='toolu_01LFvAVT3xJMeZS6kbWwBGZK')]} ## ReAct Agent Next , let 's see how to use ToolNode inside a LangGraph graph. Let' s set up a graph implementation of the ReAct agent . This agent takes some query as input , then repeatedly call tools until it has enough information to resolve the query . We 'll be using ToolNode and the Anthropic model with tools we just defined from typing import Literal from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END def should_continue(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] last_message = messages[-1] if last_message.tool_calls: return \"tools\" return END def call_model(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages) return {\"messages\": [response]} workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState) Define the two nodes we will cycle between # workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model) workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node) workflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\") workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"agent\", should_continue, [\"tools\", END]) workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\") app = workflow.compile() from IPython.display import Image, display try: display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png())) except Exception: # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional pass example with a single tool call # for chunk in app.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"human\", \"what's the weather in sf?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\" ): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print() ================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m================================= what's the weather in sf? ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Okay, let's check the weather in San Francisco:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX', 'input': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX) Call ID: toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX Args: location: San Francisco =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 60 degrees and foggy. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== The weather in San Francisco is currently 60 degrees with foggy conditions. example with a multiple tool calls in succession # for chunk in app.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"human\", \"what's the weather in the coolest cities?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\", ): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print() ================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m================================= what's the weather in the coolest cities? ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Okay, let's find out the weather in the coolest cities:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95', 'input': {}, 'name': 'get_coolest_cities', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_coolest_cities (toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95) Call ID: toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95 Args: =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_coolest_cities nyc, sf ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Now let's get the weather for those cities:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV', 'input': {'location': 'nyc'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV) Call ID: toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV Args: location: nyc =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 90 degrees and sunny. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'id': 'toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e', 'input': {'location': 'sf'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e) Call ID: toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e Args: location: sf =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 60 degrees and foggy. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== Based on the results, it looks like the weather in the coolest cities is: - New York City: 90 degrees and sunny - San Francisco: 60 degrees and foggy So the weather in the coolest cities is a mix of warm and cool temperatures, with some sunny and some foggy conditions. ``` ToolNode can also handle errors during tool execution.

You define the behavior of your agents using three key components: State: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel. Nodes: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State. Edges: Python functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current State. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions. By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' Python code. In short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next. LangGraph's underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. A super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an inactive state. A node becomes active when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or \"channels\"). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to halt by marking themselves as inactive. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are inactive and no messages are in transit. StateGraph: The StateGraph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined State object. Compiling your graph: To build your graph, you first define the state , you then add nodes and edges , and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed? Compiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like checkpointers and breakpoints . You compile your graph by just calling the .compile method: graph = graph_builder.compile(...) Note: You MUST compile your graph before you can use it. Multiple schemas Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this: Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output. We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key. It is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, PrivateState . Let's look at an example: class InputState ( TypedDict ): user_input: str class OutputState ( TypedDict ): graph_output: str class OverallState ( TypedDict ): foo: str user_input: str graph_output: str class PrivateState ( TypedDict ): bar: str def node_1 ( state: InputState ) -> OverallState: # Write to OverallState return { \"foo\" : state [ \"user_input\" ] + \" name\" } def node_2 ( state: OverallState ) -> PrivateState: # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState return { \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + \" is\" } def node_3 ( state: PrivateState ) -> OutputState: # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState return { \"graph_output\" : state [ \"bar\" ] + \" Lance\" } builder = StateGraph ( OverallState , input = InputState , output = OutputState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , node_2 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_3\" , node_3 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_2\" , \"node_3\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_3\" , END ) graph = builder . compile () graph . invoke ({ \"user_input\" : \"My\" }) { 'graph_output' : 'My name is Lance' } There are two subtle and important points to note here: We pass state: InputState as the input schema to node_1. But, we write out to foo, a channel in OverallState. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node can write to any state channel in the graph state. The graph state is the union of of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes OverallState and the filters InputState and OutputState. We initialize the graph with StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState). So, how can we write to PrivateState in node_2? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the StateGraph initialization? We can do this because nodes can also declare additional state channels as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the PrivateState schema is defined, so we can add bar as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.","title":"Graphs"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#reducers","text":"Reducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the State. Each key in the State has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer: Default Reducer These two examples show how to use the default reducer: Example A: from typing_extensions import TypedDict class State ( TypedDict ): foo : int bar : list [ str ] In this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let's assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]} Example B: from typing import Annotated from typing_extensions import TypedDict from operator import add class State ( TypedDict ): foo : int bar : Annotated [ list [ str ], add ] In this example, we've used the Annotated type to specify a reducer function (operator.add) for the second key (bar). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let's assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}. Notice here that the bar key is updated by adding the two lists together.","title":"Reducers"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#working-with-messages-in-graph-state","text":"Why use messages? Most modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's ChatModel in particular accepts a list of Message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as HumanMessage (user input) or AIMessage (LLM response). To read more about what message objects are, please refer to this conceptual guide. Using Messages in your Graph In many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of Message objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see messages key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of Message objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use operator.add as a reducer. However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use operator.add, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt add_messages function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly. Serialization In addition to keeping track of message IDs, the add_messages function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain Message objects whenever a state update is received on the messages channel. See more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization here. This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format: # this is supported { \"messages\" : [ HumanMessage ( content = \"message\" )]} # and this is also supported { \"messages\" : [{ \"type\" : \"human\" , \"content\" : \"message\" }]} Since the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain Messages when using add_messages, you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like state[\"messages\"][-1].content. Below is an example of a graph that uses add_messages as it's reducer function. from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages from typing import Annotated from typing_extensions import TypedDict class GraphState ( TypedDict ): messages : Annotated [ list [ AnyMessage ], add_messages ] MessagesState Since having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called MessagesState which makes it easy to use messages. MessagesState is defined with a single messages key which is a list of AnyMessage objects and uses the add_messages reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like: from langgraph.graph import MessagesState class State ( MessagesState ): documents : list [ str ]","title":"Working with Messages in Graph State"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#nodes","text":"In LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions (sync or async) where the first positional argument is the state, and (optionally), the second positional argument is a \"config\", containing optional configurable parameters (such as a thread_id).

This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges: Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next. Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next. Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives. Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives. A node can have MULTIPLE outgoing edges. If a node has multiple out-going edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep. Normal Edges: If you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly. graph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\") Conditional Edges: If you want to optionally route to 1 or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed: graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function) Similar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value. By default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep. You can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function's output to the name of the next node. graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"}) Note: Use Command instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function. Command It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions: def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : return Command ( # state update update = { \"foo\" : \"bar\" }, # control flow goto = \"my_other_node\" ) With Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges): def my_node ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"my_other_node\" ]] : if state [ \"foo\" ] == \"bar\" : return Command ( update = { \"foo\" : \"baz\" }, goto = \"my_other_node\" ) Important When returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]].

In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects (e.g., related subjects) and we want to apply some other node (e.g., generate a joke) to all those objects (e.g., subjects). However, two main challenges arise. (1) the number of objects (e.g., subjects) may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) when we lay out the graph and (2) the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object). LangGraph addresses these challenges through its Send API. By utilizing conditional edges, Send can distribute different states (e.g., subjects) to multiple instances of a node (e.g., joke generation).

This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions. This how-to guide shows how to use Postgres as the backend for persisting checkpoint state using the langgraph-checkpoint-postgres library. For demonstration purposes we add persistence to the pre-built create react agent. In general, you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph builder = StateGraph ( .... ) # ... define the graph checkpointer = # postgres checkpointer (see examples below) graph = builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) ...","title":"How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#setup_1","text":"You will need access to a postgres instance.

This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions . This reference implementation shows how to use MongoDB as the backend for persisting checkpoint state using the langgraph - checkpoint - mongodb library . For demonstration purposes we add persistence to a prebuilt ReAct agent . In general , you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this : from langgraph.graph import StateGraph builder = StateGraph(...)","title":"With a connection string"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-graph_2","text":"checkpointer = # mongodb checkpointer (see examples below) graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer) ... ## Setup To use the MongoDB checkpointer , you will need a MongoDB cluster . Follow this guide to create a cluster if you don ' t already have one .

context across multiple interactions on the same thread (e.g., multiple turns of a conversation). In LangGraph functional API, this kind of memory can be added to any entrypoint() workflow using thread-level persistence. When creating a LangGraph workflow, you can set it up to persist its results by using a checkpointer: Create an instance of a checkpointer: from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver checkpointer = MemorySaver () Pass checkpointer instance to the entrypoint() decorator: from langgraph.func import entrypoint @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs ) ... Optionally expose previous parameter in the workflow function signature: @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs , * , # you can optionally specify `previous` in the workflow function signature # to access the return value from the workflow as of the last execution previous ) : previous = previous or [] combined_inputs = previous + inputs result = do_something ( combined_inputs ) ... Optionally choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as previous: @entrypoint ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) def workflow ( inputs , * , previous ) : ... result = do_something (...) return entrypoint . final ( value = result , save = combine ( inputs , result ))","title":"Utilities shared by both RedisSaver and AsyncRedisSaver"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#setup_2","text":"First we need to install the packages required % %capture -- no - stderr %pip install -- quiet - U langgraph langchain_anthropic Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use). import getpass import os def _set_env ( var : str ): if not os . environ . get ( var ): os . environ [ var ] = getpass . getpass ( f \" { var } : \" ) _set_env ( \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" )","title":"Setup"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#example-simple-chatbot-with-short-term-memory","text":"We will be using a workflow with a single task that calls a chat model.

Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the RemoveMessage modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that. The key idea is that each state key has a reducer key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default MessagesState has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these RemoveMessage modifiers. That reducer then uses these RemoveMessage to delete messages from the key. So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this RemoveMessage modifier will work. You also have to have a reducer defined that knows how to work with this. NOTE: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a user message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.","title":"How to delete messages"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#build-the-agent_1","text":"Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent. from typing import Literal from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode memory = MemorySaver() @tool def search(query: str): \"\"\"Call to surf the web.\"\"\" # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation # Don't let the LLM know this though \ud83d\ude0a return \"It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini \ud83d\ude08.\" tools = [search] tool_node = ToolNode(tools) model = ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\") bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools) def should_continue(state: MessagesState): \"\"\"Return the next node to execute.\"\"\" last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1] # If there is no function call, then we finish if not last_message.tool_calls: return END # Otherwise if there is, we continue return \"action\"","title":"Build the agent"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-function-that-calls-the-model","text":"def call_model(state: MessagesState): response = model.invoke(state[\"messages\"]) # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list return {\"messages\": response}","title":"Define the function that calls the model"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-a-new-graph","text":"workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)","title":"Define a new graph"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-two-nodes-we-will-cycle-between","text":"workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model) workflow.add_node(\"action\", tool_node)","title":"Define the two nodes we will cycle between"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#set-the-entrypoint-as-agent","text":"","title":"Set the entrypoint as agent"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#this-means-that-this-node-is-the-first-one-called","text":"workflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\")","title":"This means that this node is the first one called"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#we-now-add-a-conditional-edge","text":"workflow.add_conditional_edges( # First, we define the start node.

This will involve a few steps : - Check if the conversation is too long ( can be done by checking number of messages or length of messages ) - If yes , the create summary ( will need a prompt for this ) - Then remove all except the last N messages ## Build the chatbot from typing import Literal from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, RemoveMessage, HumanMessage from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END memory = MemorySaver()","title":"Manually deleting messages"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#we-will-add-a-summary-attribute-in-addition-to-messages-key","text":"","title":"We will add a summary attribute (in addition to messages key,"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#which-messagesstate-already-has","text":"class State(MessagesState): summary: str","title":"which MessagesState already has)"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#we-will-use-this-model-for-both-the-conversation-and-the-summarization","text":"model = ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")","title":"We will use this model for both the conversation and the summarization"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-logic-to-call-the-model","text":"def call_model(state: State): # If a summary exists, we add this in as a system message summary = state.get(\"summary\", \"\") if summary: system_message = f\"Summary of conversation earlier: {summary}\" messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_message)] + state[\"messages\"] else: messages = state[\"messages\"] response = model.invoke(messages) # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list return {\"messages\": [response]}","title":"Define the logic to call the model"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#we-now-define-the-logic-for-determining-whether-to-end-or-summarize-the-conversation","text":"def should_continue(state: State) -> Literal[\"summarize_conversation\", END]: \"\"\"Return the next node to execute.\"\"\" messages = state[\"messages\"] # If there are more than six messages, then we summarize the conversation if len(messages) > 6: return \"summarize_conversation\" # Otherwise we can just end return END def summarize_conversation(state: State): # First, we summarize the conversation summary = state.get(\"summary\", \"\") if summary: # If a summary already exists, we use a different system prompt # to summarize it than if one didn't summary_message = ( f\"This is summary of the conversation to date: {summary}\\n\\n\" \"Extend the summary by taking into account the new messages above:\" ) else: summary_message = \"Create a summary of the conversation above:\" messages = state [ \"messages\" ] + [ HumanMessage ( content = summary_message )] response = model . invoke ( messages ) # We now need to delete messages that we no longer want to show up # I will delete all but the last two messages , but you can change this delete_messages = [ RemoveMessage ( id = m . id ) for m in state [ \"messages\" ][ :- 2 ]] return { \"summary\" : response . content , \"messages\" : delete_messages }","title":"We now define the logic for determining whether to end or summarize the conversation"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-a-new-graph_1","text":"workflow = StateGraph(State)","title":"Define a new graph"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-conversation-node-and-the-summarize-node","text":"workflow.add_node(\"conversation\", call_model) workflow.add_node(summarize_conversation)","title":"Define the conversation node and the summarize node"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#set-the-entrypoint-as-conversation","text":"workflow.add_edge(START, \"conversation\")","title":"Set the entrypoint as conversation"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#we-now-add-a-conditional-edge_1","text":"workflow.add_conditional_edges( # First, we define the start node.

It is designed to work well out - of - box with LangGraph 's prebuilt ReAct agent, but can also work with any StateGraph as long as its state has a messages key with an appropriate reducer (see MessagesState). ## Define tools from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode @tool def get_weather(location: str): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location.lower() in [\"sf\", \"san francisco\"]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else: return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" @tool def get_coolest_cities(): \"\"\"Get a list of coolest cities\"\"\" return \"nyc, sf\" tools = [get_weather, get_coolest_cities] tool_node = ToolNode(tools) ## Manually call ToolNode ToolNode operates on graph state with a list of messages . It expects the last message in the list to be an AIMessage with tool_calls parameter . Let 's first see how to invoke the tool node manually: message_with_single_tool_call = AIMessage( content=\"\", tool_calls=[ { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"args\": {\"location\": \"sf\"}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", } ], ) tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [message_with_single_tool_call]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id')]} Note that typically you don 't need to create AIMessage manually, and it will be automatically generated by any LangChain chat model that supports tool calling. You can also do parallel tool calling using ToolNode if you pass multiple tool calls to AIMessage 's tool_calls parameter: message_with_multiple_tool_calls = AIMessage( content=\"\", tool_calls=[ { \"name\": \"get_coolest_cities\", \"args\": {}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id_1\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", }, { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"args\": {\"location\": \"sf\"}, \"id\": \"tool_call_id_2\", \"type\": \"tool_call\", }, ], ) tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [message_with_multiple_tool_calls]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content='nyc, sf', name='get_coolest_cities', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_1'), ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_2')]} ## Using with chat models We 'll be using a small chat model from Anthropic in our example. To use chat models with tool calling, we need to first ensure that the model is aware of the available tools. We do this by calling .bind_tools method on ChatAnthropic model from typing import Literal from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode model_with_tools = ChatAnthropic( model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\", temperature=0 ).bind_tools(tools) model_with_tools.invoke(\"what's the weather in sf?\").tool_calls [{'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'toolu_01Fwm7dg1mcJU43Fkx2pqgm8', 'type': 'tool_call'}] As you can see , the AI message generated by the chat model already has tool_calls populated , so we can just pass it directly to ToolNode tool_node.invoke({\"messages\": [model_with_tools.invoke(\"what's the weather in sf?\")]}) {'messages': [ToolMessage(content=\"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='toolu_01LFvAVT3xJMeZS6kbWwBGZK')]} ## ReAct Agent Next , let 's see how to use ToolNode inside a LangGraph graph. Let' s set up a graph implementation of the ReAct agent . This agent takes some query as input , then repeatedly call tools until it has enough information to resolve the query . We 'll be using ToolNode and the Anthropic model with tools we just defined from typing import Literal from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END def should_continue(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] last_message = messages[-1] if last_message.tool_calls: return \"tools\" return END def call_model(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages) return {\"messages\": [response]} workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)","title":"Finally, we compile it!"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#define-the-two-nodes-we-will-cycle-between_1","text":"workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model) workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node) workflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\") workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"agent\", should_continue, [\"tools\", END]) workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\") app = workflow.compile() from IPython.display import Image, display try: display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png())) except Exception: # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional pass","title":"Define the two nodes we will cycle between"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#example-with-a-single-tool-call","text":"for chunk in app.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"human\", \"what's the weather in sf?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\" ): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print() ================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m================================= what's the weather in sf? ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Okay, let's check the weather in San Francisco:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX', 'input': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX) Call ID: toolu_01LdmBXYeccWKdPrhZSwFCDX Args: location: San Francisco =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 60 degrees and foggy. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== The weather in San Francisco is currently 60 degrees with foggy conditions.","title":"example with a single tool call"},{"location":"AIML/AgenticAI/langgraph.html#example-with-a-multiple-tool-calls-in-succession","text":"for chunk in app.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"human\", \"what's the weather in the coolest cities?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\", ): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print() ================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m================================= what's the weather in the coolest cities? ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Okay, let's find out the weather in the coolest cities:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95', 'input': {}, 'name': 'get_coolest_cities', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_coolest_cities (toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95) Call ID: toolu_01LFZUWTccyveBdaSAisMi95 Args: =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_coolest_cities nyc, sf ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'text': \"Now let's get the weather for those cities:\", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV', 'input': {'location': 'nyc'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV) Call ID: toolu_01RHPQBhT1u6eDnPqqkGUpsV Args: location: nyc =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 90 degrees and sunny. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== [{'id': 'toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e', 'input': {'location': 'sf'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}] Tool Calls: get_weather (toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e) Call ID: toolu_01W5sFGF8PfgYzdY4CqT5c6e Args: location: sf =================================\u001b[1m Tool Message \u001b[0m================================= Name: get_weather It's 60 degrees and foggy. ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m================================== Based on the results, it looks like the weather in the coolest cities is: - New York City: 90 degrees and sunny - San Francisco: 60 degrees and foggy So the weather in the coolest cities is a mix of warm and cool temperatures, with some sunny and some foggy conditions. ``` ToolNode can also handle errors during tool execution.

The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving and we wake up to new news almost every day. What we need to learn now is MCP (Model Context Protocol). Before moving on to what it is and its purpose, let\u2019s look at what the protocol means. To make things clearer, it\u2019s neither a framework like LangChain nor a tool; it\u2019s a protocol similar to HTTP for the web or SMTP for messaging. A more relevant example could be LSP (Language Server Protocol), which standardizes adding support for programming languages across an ecosystem of development tools. Similarly, MCP standardizes the integration of additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications. It provides the universal rules that allow any client to communicate with any server, regardless of who built either component, creating a foundation for a diverse and interoperable AI ecosystem. Anthropic defines it as the USB-C port equivalent for agentic systems. It standardizes the connection between AI applications, LLMs, and external data sources (Databases, Gmail, Slack, etc.). The Machines are the clients, the peripheral devices are tools, and the MCP is the Type-C port. So, it doesn\u2019t matter who makes the device or peripherals; they work together seamlessly. MCP defines how clients should communicate with servers and how servers should handle tools (APIs, Functions, etc.) and resources (read-only files like logs, db records, etc.) Why should you care about MCP? # Benefits of Standardization # Unified Integration: A single protocol for connecting any LLM to any tool Reduced Development Time: Standard patterns for resource access and tool execution Clear Separation of Concerns: Data access (resources) and computation (tools) are cleanly separated Consistent Discovery: Uniform mechanisms for finding available capabilities (tools, resources, prompts, roots, sampling) Cross-Platform Compatibility: Tools built for one system work with others Is it revolutionary? # Short answer: No. You can live without MCP. It is not revolutionary but brings standardization to the otherwise chaotic space of agentic development. If your application is MCP client-compliant, you can connect to any MCP client-compliant server. In an alternate world, as a client developer, you have to tailor the servers according to your needs, and others cannot build for your platform. The same is true for server developers. For example, Inside Cursor, you can connect to any MCP server if they follow the protocols. At this point, you will be more or less clear about the purpose of the MCP. Now, let\u2019s understand MCP for crystal clear clarity. MCP Architecture # The Model Context Protocol has several key components that work together. Here\u2019s a high-level diagram. The complete MCP architecture consists of four parts Host: Coordinates the overall system and manages LLM interactions Clients: Connect hosts to servers with 1:1 relationships Servers: Provide specialized capabilities through tools, resources, and prompts Base Protocol: Defines how all these components communicate In the above chart, the Client and Host are merged; we will keep them separate to clarify things. So, let\u2019s go through each component and understand MCP from within. 1. Host # Hosts are the LLM applications that expect data from servers. Hosts can be an IDE, Chatbot, or any LLM application. They are responsible for Initializing and managing multiple clients. Client-server lifecycle management Handles user authorization decisions Manages context aggregation across clients Examples are Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, Windsurf IDE, etc. 2. Client # Each client has these key responsibilities: Dedicated connections: Each client maintains a one-to-one stateful connection with a single server. This focused relationship ensures clear communication boundaries and security isolation. Message routing: Clients handle all bidirectional communication, efficiently routing requests, responses, and notifications between the host and their connected server. We will see a small example of it in Cursor IDE with Linear and Slack. Capability management: Clients monitor what their connected server can do by maintaining information about available tools, resources (contextual data), and prompt templates. Protocol negotiation: During initialization, clients negotiate protocol versions and capabilities, ensuring compatibility between the host and server. Subscription management: Clients maintain subscriptions to server resources and handle notification events when those resources change. 3. Server # Servers are the fundamental building block that enriches LLMs with external data and context. The key server primitives include: The tools are executable functions that allow LLM to interact with external apps. Tools function similarly to functions in traditional LLM calls. A tool can be a POST request to API endpoints; for example, a tool defined as LIST_FILES with a directory name as a parameter will fetch the files in the directory and send them back to the client. The tools can also be API calls to external services like Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc. Resources: These are any. Text files, Log files, DB schema, File contents, and Git history. They provide additional context to the LLMs. Prompt Templates: Pre-defined templates or instructions that guide language model interactions. Tools are model-controlled, while Reosuces and Prompts are user-controlled. The models can automatically discover and invoke tools based on a given context. Base Protocol # The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to establish communication JSON-RPC message format Stateful connections Server and client capability negotiation Features # Servers offer any of the following features to clients: Resources: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use Prompts: Templated messages and workflows for users Tools: Functions for the AI model to execute Additional Utilities # Configuration Progress tracking Cancellation Error reporting Logging Security and Trust & Safety # The Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access and code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust considerations that all implementors must carefully address. Key Principles # User Consent and Control Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities Data Privacy Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent User data should be protected with appropriate access controls Tool Safety Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate caution Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use LLM Sampling Controls Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests Users should control: Whether sampling occurs at all The actual prompt that will be sent What results the server can see The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts Implementation Guidelines # While MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level, implementors SHOULD: Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications Provide clear documentation of security implications Implement appropriate access controls and data protections Follow security best practices in their integrations Consider privacy implications in their feature designs What is Protocol? # In the computer world, a protocol is a set of rules that determine how two systems will communicate with each other. Protocols regulate data transfer in computer networks, internet communication, and between software systems. For example: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Allows websites to communicate with browsers. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): Defines how data packets on the internet will be routed. JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call): A protocol that allows data exchange in JSON format. What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)? # The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables large language models (LLMs) to integrate with external data sources and tools in a standardized way. Developed by Anthropic, this protocol makes it easy for AI models to work seamlessly with a variety of tools and data sources. MCP can be likened to the USB-C port, which has become a global standard for device connections. Just as USB-C provides a common connection point between different devices, MCP enables AI systems to communicate with data and tools in a standard way. Why Use MCP? # MCP functions similarly to APIs, but has a wider potential for use. While traditional APIs require a separate implementation for each integration, a single integration with MCP provides access to many different data sources and tools. MCP also provides two-way communication. In other words, an AI model can not only receive data, but also trigger certain actions. Architecture of MCP # MCP is based on a simple client-server architecture. An application can connect to multiple MCP servers at the same time. The structure consists of the following components: MCP Hosts: Applications act as MCP hosts to access data or tools. MCP Clients: Clients within the host establish one-to-one connections with MCP servers. MCP Servers: Lightweight, provide specific functionality through MCP, and can connect to local or remote data sources. Local Data Sources: Data that can be accessed by MCP servers, such as files and databases. Remote Services: External Internet-based APIs that MCP servers can access. Connection Lifecycle # Initialization The client sends an initialize request to the server, containing its own protocol version and capabilities. The server responds with its own protocol version and capabilities. The client sends the initialized notification. The connection is established and the message exchange begins. Message Exchange Once the connection is established, request and response messages can be sent between the client and the server, or one-way messages can be transmitted. Termination The client or server can terminate the connection. Key Features of MCP # MCP uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 message format to communicate between the client and server. Some of the protocol\u2019s prominent features are: Resources: Data and content presented to the user or AI model. Prompts: Predefined messages and workflows prepared for users. Tools: Functions that the AI \u200b\u200bmodel can run. Hands On Project # In this project, we will create a structure that brings the latest news from a website. In the document, they recommend using uv package manager instead of pip. So, you can open a terminal and download it to MacOs and Linux with the first command below. You can download it to Windows with the second command. curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\" Don\u2019t forget to restart your terminal after doing this. Then we will create a directory for our project. To do this, open the terminal in the directory where you want to create the project and run the following commands. The first command creates a project file in the directory you are in.

It works step by step as follows. First, we make the necessary imports. No API was used in this code, but if you use the API, you can use load_dotenv() to get your keys. We initialize our server with FastMCP. \u201cnews-app/1.0\u201d is the application name we gave. NEW_SITES contains the sites from which the news will be retrieved. You can add more sites here if you want. The fetch_news() function retrieves the news from the specified sites. The get_tech_news() function is our tool here. We specify that this is a tool by adding the @mcp.tool() decorator to the function. Having a docstring in this function is important for the model to understand how the tool works. Our MCP Server is running with mcp.run(transport=\u201dstdio\u201d). But we will not run the server via vscode. Claude desktop can directly run the MCP Server we prepared, so we will use Claude Desktop. You can download it from here: https://claude.ai/download. Then we open the setting and enter the developer settings. From here we click on edit config. claude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\": { \"mcp-server-project\": { \"command\": \"/Users/ganeshkinkargiri./.local/bin/uv\", \"args\": [ \"--directory\", \"/Users/ganeshkinkargiri./Desktop/LLM-FINE-TUNE/Agentic-AI/langgraph/mcp-server-project\", \"run\", \"main.py\" ] } } } When we click on edit config, it opens a folder for us. From this folder, we play the claude_desktop_config.json file with a text editor. We will enter our server information here. This file contains how our server will be run by claude. There are a few points to note: mcp-server-project is the name of the project file we created. If you created it with a different name, you can change this. You should add the path where the uv package manager is located to the command section. In this section, only \u201cuv\u201d is written in the document, but it did not work that way for me, so I gave the path. You can run the \u201cwhich uv\u201d command in the terminal to find the path. You can also change the path in args to your own project path. To do this, you can run the \u201cpwd\u201d command in this directory in the terminal and get the full path. You can save and close the file. We have completed our server configurations, now we can try it on Claude desktop. When you open Claude desktop, if there is a problem, you can see error pop-ups on the top right. You need to click and examine the log files and solve the error. If you do not receive an error, you should see the hammer in the red square. When you click on Hammer, it shows you the available MCP Tools as below. Alternatively, you can test it with the MCP Inspector: # In the context of agentic AI, MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open standard that facilitates seamless communication and data exchange between AI agents and external systems, enabling them to access and utilize data and tools efficiently. MCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need. Model Context Protocol # The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving and we wake up to new news almost every day. What we need to learn now is MCP (Model Context Protocol). Before moving on to what it is and its purpose, let\u2019s look at what the protocol means. To make things clearer, it\u2019s neither a framework like LangChain nor a tool; it\u2019s a protocol similar to HTTP for the web or SMTP for messaging. A more relevant example could be LSP (Language Server Protocol), which standardizes adding support for programming languages across an ecosystem of development tools. Similarly, MCP standardizes the integration of additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications. It provides the universal rules that allow any client to communicate with any server, regardless of who built either component, creating a foundation for a diverse and interoperable AI ecosystem. Anthropic defines it as the USB-C port equivalent for agentic systems. It standardizes the connection between AI applications, LLMs, and external data sources (Databases, Gmail, Slack, etc.). The Machines are the clients, the peripheral devices are tools, and the MCP is the Type-C port. So, it doesn\u2019t matter who makes the device or peripherals; they work together seamlessly.

For example, Inside Cursor, you can connect to any MCP server if they follow the protocols. At this point, you will be more or less clear about the purpose of the MCP.

Deep learning can be defined as the method of machine learning and artificial intelligence that is intended to intimidate humans and their actions based on certain human brain functions to make effective decisions. It is a very important data science element that channels its modeling based on data-driven techniques under predictive modeling and statistics . To drive such a human-like ability to adapt and learn and to function accordingly, there have to be some strong forces which we popularly called algorithms . Deep learning algorithms are dynamically made to run through several layers of neural networks, which are nothing but a set of decision-making networks that are pre-trained to serve a task. Later, each of these is passed through simple layered representations and move on to the next layer. However, most machine learning is trained to work fairly well on datasets that have to deal with hundreds of features or columns. For a data set to be structured or unstructured, machine learning tends to fail mostly because they fail to recognize a simple image having a dimension of 800x1000 in RGB. It becomes quite unfeasible for a traditional machine learning algorithm to handle such depths. This is where deep learning . Importance of Deep Learning # Deep learning algorithms play a crucial role in determining the features and can handle the large number of processes for the data that might be structured or unstructured. Although, deep learning algorithms can overkill some tasks that might involve complex problems because they need access to huge amounts of data so that they can function effectively. For example, there's a popular deep learning tool that recognizes images namely Imagenet that has access to 14 million images in its dataset-driven algorithms. It is a highly comprehensive tool that has defined a next-level benchmark for deep learning tools that aim images as their dataset. Deep learning algorithms are highly progressive algorithms that learn about the image by passing it through each neural network layer. The layers are highly sensitive to detect low-level features of the image like edges and pixels and henceforth the combined layers take this information and form holistic representations by comparing it with previous data. For example, the middle layer might be programmed to detect some special parts of the object in the photograph which other deep trained layers are programmed to detect special objects like dogs, trees, utensils, etc. However, if we talk out the simple task that involves less complexity and a data-driven resource, deep learning algorithms fail to generalize simple data. This is one of the main reasons deep learning is not considered effective as linear or boosted tree models. Simple models aim to churn out custom data, track fraudulent transactions and deal with less complex datasets with fewer features. Also, there are various cases like multiclass classification where deep learning can be effective because it involves smaller but more structured datasets but is not preferred usually. Deep Learning Algorithms # 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) # CNN's popularly known as ConvNets majorly consists of several layers and are specifically used for image processing and detection of objects. CNNs have wide usage in identifying the image of the satellites, medical image processing, series forecasting, and anomaly detection. CNNs process the data by passing it through multiple layers and extracting features to exhibit convolutional operations. The Convolutional Layer consists of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) that outlasts to rectify the feature map. The Pooling layer is used to rectify these feature maps into the next feed. Pooling is generally a sampling algorithm that is down-sampled and it reduces the dimensions of the feature map. Later, the result generated consists of 2-D arrays consisting of single, long, continuous , and linear vector flattened in the map. The next layer i.e., called Fully Connected Layer which forms the flattened matrix or 2-D array fetched from the Pooling Layer as input and identifies the image by classifying it. 2. Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) # LSTMs can be defined as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that are programmed to learn and adapt for dependencies for the long term. It can memorize and recall past data for a greater period and by default, it is its sole behavior. LSTMs are designed to retain over time and henceforth they are majorly used in time series predictions because they can restrain memory or previous inputs. This analogy comes from their chain-like structure consisting of four interacting layers that communicate with each other differently. Besides applications of time series prediction, they can be used to construct speech recognizers, development in pharmaceuticals, and composition of music loops as well. 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) # Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs consist of some directed connections that form a cycle that allow the input provided from the LSTMs to be used as input in the current phase of RNNs. These inputs are deeply embedded as inputs and enforce the memorization ability of LSTMs lets these inputs get absorbed for a period in the internal memory. RNNs are therefore dependent on the inputs that are preserved by LSTMs and work under the synchronization phenomenon of LSTMs. RNNs are mostly used in captioning the image, time series analysis, recognizing handwritten data, and translating data to machines. RNNs follow the work approach by putting output feeds (t-1) time if the time is defined as t. Next, the output determined by t is feed at input time t+1. Similarly, these processes are repeated for all the input consisting of any length. There's also a fact about RNNs is that they store historical information and there's no increase in the input size even if the model size is increased. RNNs look something like this when unfolded. 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) # GANs are defined as deep learning algorithms that are used to generate new instances of data that match the training data. GAN usually consists of two components namely a generator that learns to generate false data and a discriminator that adapts itself by learning from this false data. Over some time, GANs have gained immense usage since they are frequently being used to clarify astronomical images and simulate lensing the gravitational dark matter. It is also used in video games to increase graphics for 2D textures by recreating them in higher resolution like 4K . They are also used in creating realistic cartoons character and also rendering human faces and 3D object rendering . GANs work in simulation by generating and understanding the fake data and the real data. During the training to understand these data, the generator produces different kinds of fake data where the discriminator quickly learns to adapt and respond to it as false data. GANs then send these recognized results for updating. Consider the below image to visualize the functioning. 5. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) # RBFNs are specific types of neural networks that follow a feed-forward approach and make use of radial functions as activation functions. They consist of three layers namely the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer which are mostly used for time-series prediction, regression testing, and classification . RBFNs do these tasks by measuring the similarities present in the training data set. They usually have an input vector that feeds these data into the input layer thereby confirming the identification and rolling out results by comparing previous data sets. Precisely, the input layer has neurons that are sensitive to these data and the nodes in the layer are efficient in classifying the class of data. Neurons are originally present in the hidden layer though they work in close integration with the input layer. The hidden layer contains Gaussian transfer functions that are inversely proportional to the distance of the output from the neuron's center. The output layer has linear combinations of the radial-based data where the Gaussian functions are passed in the neuron as parameter and output is generated. Consiider the given image below to understand the process thoroughly. 6. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) # MLPs are the base of deep learning technology. It belongs to a class of feed-forward neural networks having various layers of perceptrons . These perceptrons have various activation functions in them. MLPs also have connected input and output layers and their number is the same. Also, there's a layer that remains hidden amidst these two layers. MLPs are mostly used to build image and speech recognition systems or some other types of the translation software . The working of MLPs starts by feeding the data in the input layer. The neurons present in the layer form a graph to establish a connection that passes in one direction. The weight of this input data is found to exist between the hidden layer and the input layer. MLPs use activation functions to determine which nodes are ready to fire. These activation functions include tanh function, sigmoid and ReLUs . MLPs are mainly used to train the models to understand what kind of co-relation the layers are serving to achieve the desired output from the given data set. 7. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) # SOMs were invented by Teuvo Kohenen for achieving data visualization to understand the dimensions of data through artificial and self-organizing neural networks. The attempts to achieve data visualization to solve problems are mainly done by what humans cannot visualize. These data are generally high-dimensional so there are lesser chances of human involvement and of course less error. SOMs help in visualizing the data by initializing weights of different nodes and then choose random vectors from the given training data. They examine each node to find the relative weights so that dependencies can be understood. The winning node is decided and that is called Best Matching Unit (BMU). Later, SOMs discover these winning nodes but the nodes reduce over time from the sample vector. So, the closer the node to BMU more is the more chance to recognize the weight and carry out further activities. There are also multiple iterations done to ensure that no node closer to BMU is missed. One example of such is the RGB color combinations that we use in our daily tasks. Consider the below image to understand how they function. 8. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) # DBNs are called generative models because they have various layers of latent as well as stochastic variables. The latent variable is called a hidden unit because they have binary values. DBNs are also called Boltzmann Machines because the RGM layers are stacked over each other to establish communication with previous and consecutive layers. DBNs are used in applications like video and image recognition as well as capturing motional objects. DBNs are powered by Greedy algorithms . The layer to layer approach by leaning through a top-down approach to generate weights is the most common way DBNs function. DBNs use step by step approach of Gibbs sampling on the hidden two-layer at the top. Then, these stages draw a sample from the visible units using a model that follows the ancestral sampling method. DBNs learn from the values present in the latent value from every layer following the bottom-up pass approach. 9. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) # RBMs were developed by Geoffrey Hinton and resemble stochastic neural networks that learn from the probability distribution in the given input set. This algorithm is mainly used in the field of dimension reduction, regression and classification, topic modeling and are considered the building blocks of DBNs. RBIs consist of two layers namely the visible layer and the hidden layer . Both of these layers are connected through hidden units and have bias units connected to nodes that generate the output. Usually, RBMs have two phases namely forward pass and backward pass . The functioning of RBMs is carried out by accepting inputs and translating them to numbers so that inputs are encoded in the forward pass. RBMs take into account the weight of every input, and the backward pass takes these input weights and translates them further into reconstructed inputs. Later, both of these translated inputs, along with individual weights, are combined. These inputs are then pushed to the visible layer where the activation is carried out, and output is generated that can be easily reconstructed. To understand this process, consider the below image. Autoencoders # Autoencoders are a special type of neural network where inputs are outputs are found usually identical. It was designed to primarily solve the problems related to unsupervised learning. Autoencoders are highly trained neural networks that replicate the data. It is the reason why the input and output are generally the same. They are used to achieve tasks like pharma discovery, image processing, and population prediction . Autoencoders constitute three components namely the encoder, the code, and the decoder . Autoencoders are built in such a structure that they can receive inputs and transform them into various representations. The attempts to copy the original input by reconstructing them is more accurate. They do this by encoding the image or input, reduce the size. If the image is not visible properly they are passed to the neural network for clarification. Then, the clarified image is termed a reconstructed image and this resembles as accurate as of the previous image. To understand this complex process, see the below-provided image.","title":"DeepLearning algorithms"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/DeepLearning-algorithms.html#deep-learning-algorithms","text":"What is Deep Learning Algorithm?

At the outer most ring you have artificial intelligence (using computers to reason). One layer inside of that is machine learning. With artificial neural networks and deep learning at the center. Broadly speaking, deep learning is a more approachable name for an artificial neural network. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning refers to the depth of the network. An artificial neural network can be very shallow. Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the cerebral cortex. At the basic level is the perceptron, the mathematical representation of a biological neuron. Like in the cerebral cortex, there can be several layers of interconnected perceptrons. The first layer is the input layer. Each node in this layer takes an input, and then passes its output as the input to each node in the next layer. There are generally no connections between nodes in the same layer and the last layer produces the outputs. We call the middle part the hidden layer. These neurons have no connection to the outside (e.g. input or output) and are only activated by nodes in the previous layer. Think of deep learning as the technique for learning in neural networks that utilizes multiple layers of abstraction to solve pattern recognition problems. In the 1980s, most neural networks were a single layer due to the cost of computation and availability of data. Machine learning is considered a branch or approach of Artificial intelligence, whereas deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning. Machine learning involves computer intelligence that doesn\u2019t know the answers up front. Instead, the program will run against training data, verify the success of its attempts, and modify its approach accordingly. Machine learning typical requires a sophisticated education, spanning software engineering and computer science to statistical methods and linear algebra. There are two broad classes of machine learning methods: Supervised learning Unsupervised learning In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm uses a labeled dataset to infer the desired outcome. This takes a lot of data and time, since the data needs to be labeled by hand. Supervised learning is great for classification and regression problems. For example, let\u2019s say that we were running a company and want to determine the effect of bonuses on employee retention. If we had historical data \u2013 i.e. employee bonus amount and tenure \u2013 we could use supervised machine learning. With unsupervised learning, there aren\u2019t any predefined or corresponding answers. The goal is to figure out the hidden patterns in the data. It\u2019s usually used for clustering and associative tasks, like grouping customers by behavior. Amazon\u2019s \u201ccustomers who also bought\u2026\u201d recommendations are a type of associative task. While supervised learning can be useful, we often have to resort to unsupervised learning. Deep learning has proven to be an effective unsupervised learning technique. Why is Deep Learning Important? # Computers have long had techniques for recognizing features inside of images. The results weren\u2019t always great. Computer vision has been a main beneficiary of deep learning. Computer vision using deep learning now rivals humans on many image recognition tasks. Facebook has had great success with identifying faces in photographs by using deep learning. It\u2019s not just a marginal improvement, but a game changer: \u201cAsked whether two unfamiliar photos of faces show the same person, a human being will get it right 97.53 percent of the time. New software developed by researchers at Facebook can score 97.25 percent on the same challenge, regardless of variations in lighting or whether the person in the picture is directly facing the camera.\u201d Speech recognition is a another area that\u2019s felt deep learning\u2019s impact. Spoken languages are so vast and ambiguous. Baidu \u2013 one of the leading search engines of China \u2013 has developed a voice recognition system that is faster and more accurate than humans at producing text on a mobile phone. In both English and Mandarin. What is particularly fascinating, is that generalizing the two languages didn\u2019t require much additional design effort: \u201cHistorically, people viewed Chinese and English as two vastly different languages, and so there was a need to design very different features,\u201d Andrew Ng says, chief scientist at Baidu. \u201cThe learning algorithms are now so general that you can just learn.\u201d Google is now using deep learning to manage the energy at the company\u2019s data centers. They\u2019ve cut their energy needs for cooling by 40%. That translates to about a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency for the company and hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. Deep Learning Microservices # Here\u2019s a quick overview of some deep learning use cases and microservices. Illustration Tagger. An implementation of Illustration2Vec, this microservice can tag an image with the safe, questionable, or explicit rating, the copyright, and general category tag to understand what\u2019s in the image. DeepFilter is a style transfer service for applying artistic filters to images. The age classifier uses face detection to determine the age of a person in a photo. The Places 365 Classifier uses a pre-trained CNN and based on Places: An Image Database for Deep Scene Understanding B. Zhou, et al., 2016 to identify particular locations in images, such as a courtyard, drugstore, hotel room, glacier, mountain, etc. Lastly, there is InceptionNet, a direct implementation of Google\u2019s InceptionNet using TensorFlow. It takes an image (such as a car), and returns the top 5 classes the model predicts are relevant to the image. Open Source Deep Learning Frameworks # Deep learnings is made accessible by a number of open source projects. Some of the most popular technologies include, but are not limited to, Deeplearning4j (DL4j), Theano, Torch, TensorFlow, and Caffe. The deciding factors on which one to use are the tech stack they target, and if they are low-level, academic, or application focused. Here\u2019s an overview of each: DL4J: JVM-based Distrubted Integrates with Hadoop and Spark Theano: Very popular in Academia Fairly low level Interfaced with via Python and Numpy Torch: Lua based In house versions used by Facebook and Twitter Contains pretrained models TensorFlow: Google written successor to Theano Interfaced with via Python and Numpy Highly parallel Can be somewhat slow for certain problem sets Caffe: Not general purpose. Focuses on machine-vision problems Implemented in C++ and is very fast Not easily extensible Has a Python interface McCulloch and Pitts Neuron # In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts introduced a mathematical model of a neuron. It consisted of three components: A set of weights corresponding to synapses (inputs) An adder for summing input signals; analogous to cell membrane that collects charge An activation function for determining when the neuron fires, based on accumulated input A single neuron is not interesting, nor useful, from a learning perspective. It cannot learn; it simply receives inputs and either fires or not. Only when neurons are joined as a network can they perform useful work. Learning takes place by changing the weights of the connections in a neural network, and by changing the parameters of the activation functions of neurons. Perceptron # A collection of McCullough and Pitts neurons, along with a set of input nodes connected to the inputs via weighted edges, is a perceptron, the simplest neural network. Each neuron is independent of the others in the perceptron, in the sense that its behavior and performance depends only on its own weights and threshold values, and not of those for the other neurons. Though they share inputs, they operate independently. The number of inputs and outputs are determined by the data. Weights are stored as a N x K matrix, with N observations and K neurons, with specifying the weight on the ith observation on the jth neuron. Learning with Perceptrons # Example: Logical functions # Let's see how the perceptron learns by training it on a couple of of logical functions, AND and OR. For two variables x1 and x2, the AND function returns 1 if both are true, or zero otherwise; the OR function returns 1 if either variable is true, or both. These functions can be expressed as simple lookup tables. % matplotlib inline import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns . set () from scipy import optimize from ipywidgets import * from IPython.display import SVG from sklearn import datasets AND = pd.DataFrame({'x1': (0,0,1,1), 'x2': (0,1,0,1), 'y': (0,0,0,1)}) AND x1 x2 y 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 3 1 1 1 First, we need to initialize weights to small, random values (can be positive and negative). w = np.random.randn(3)*1e-4 Then, a simple activation function for calculating g(h): g = lambda inputs, weights: np.where(np.dot(inputs, weights)>0, 1, 0) Finally, a training function that iterates the learning algorithm, returning the adapted weights. def train(inputs, targets, weights, eta, n_iterations): # Add the inputs that match the bias node inputs = np.c_[inputs, -np.ones((len(inputs), 1))] for n in range(n_iterations): activations = g(inputs, weights); weights -= eta*np.dot(np.transpose(inputs), activations - targets) return(weights) Let's test it first on the AND function. inputs = AND[['x1','x2']] target = AND['y'] w = train(inputs, target, w, 0.25, 10) Checking the performance: g(np.c_[inputs, -np.ones((len(inputs), 1))], w) array([0, 0, 0, 1]) Thus, it has learned the function perfectly. Now for OR: OR = pd.DataFrame({'x1': (0,0,1,1), 'x2': (0,1,0,1), 'y': (0,1,1,1)}) OR x1 x2 y 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 w = np.random.randn(3)*1e-4 inputs = OR[['x1','x2']] target = OR['y'] w = train(inputs, target, w, 0.25, 20) g(np.c_[inputs, -np.ones((len(inputs), 1))], w) array([0, 1, 1, 1]) Also 100% correct. Exercise: XOR Now try running the model on the XOR function, where a one is returned for either x1 or x2 being true, but not both. What happens here? Let's explore the problem graphically: AND.plot(kind='scatter', x='x1', y='x2', c='y', s=50, colormap='winter') plt.plot(np.linspace(0,1.4), 1.5 - 1*np.linspace(0,1.4), 'k--'); XOR = pd.DataFrame({'x1': (0,0,1,1), 'x2': (0,1,0,1), 'y': (0,1,1,0)}) XOR.plot(kind='scatter', x='x1', y='x2', c='y', s=50, colormap='winter'); Multi-layer Perceptron # The solution to fitting more complex (i.e. non-linear) models with neural networks is to use a more complex network that consists of more than just a single perceptron. The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply add more weights. There are two ways to add complexity: Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a recurrent network Add neurons between the input nodes and the outputs, creating an additional (\"hidden\") layer to the network, resulting in a multi-layer perceptron The latter approach is more common in applications of neural networks. How to train a multilayer network is not intuitive. Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer. However, the process for updating the weights based on the prediction error is less clear, since it is difficult to know whether to change the weights on the input layer or on the hidden layer in order to improve the prediction. Updating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a matter of: 1. moving for ward through the network , calculating outputs given input s and current weight estimates 2. moving backward updating weights according to the resulting error from for ward propagation . In this sense, it is similar to a single-layer perceptron, except it has to be done twice, once for each layer. Backpropagation # Backpropagation is a method for efficiently computing the gradient of the cost function of a neural network with respect to its parameters. These partial derivatives can then be used to update the network's parameters using, e.g., gradient descent. This may be the most common method for training neural networks. Deriving backpropagation involves numerous clever applications of the chain rule for functions of vectors. Review: The chain rule # Notation # Backpropagation in general # Backpropagation in practice # Toy Python example # Due to the recursive nature of the backpropagation algorithm, it lends itself well to software implementations. The following code implements a multi-layer perceptron which is trained using backpropagation with user-supplied nonlinearities, layer sizes, and cost function. # Ensure python 3 forward compatibility from __future__ import print_function import numpy as np def sigmoid ( x ): return 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - x )) class SigmoidLayer : def __init__ ( self , n_input , n_output ): self .

Weight matrices W1 and W2 and bias vectors b1 and b2 are initialized randomly. The learning rate is set to 0.5. Forward Propagation : Compute the input and output for the hidden layer. Compute the input and output for the output layer (predicted output). Error Calculation : Compute the error by subtracting the predicted output from the actual output. Backpropagation : Compute the gradient of the error with respect to the predicted output. Compute the error propagated back to the hidden layer. Compute the gradient of the hidden layer output. Weight and Bias Update : Update the weights and biases for both layers using the computed gradients and learning rate. Training Loop : The above steps are repeated for a specified number of epochs (10,000 in this case). After training, the final predicted output, weights, and biases are printed. This simple example uses a neural network with one hidden layer to demonstrate the key concepts of backpropagation. this activation function may take any of several forms, such as a logistic function. Example of Deep Learning # In the example given above, we provide the raw data of images to the first layer of the input layer. After then, these input layer will determine the patterns of local contrast that means it will differentiate on the basis of colors, luminosity, etc. Then the 1st hidden layer will determine the face feature, i.e., it will fixate on eyes, nose, and lips, etc. And then, it will fixate those face features on the correct face template. So, in the 2nd hidden layer, it will actually determine the correct face here as it can be seen in the above image, after which it will be sent to the output layer. Likewise, more hidden layers can be added to solve more complex problems, for example, if you want to find out a particular kind of face having large or light complexions. So, as and when the hidden layers increase, we are able to solve complex problems. Types of Deep Learning Networks # 1. Feed Forward Neural Network # A feed-forward neural network is none other than an Artificial Neural Network, which ensures that the nodes do not form a cycle. In this kind of neural network, all the perceptrons are organized within layers, such that the input layer takes the input, and the output layer generates the output. Since the hidden layers do not link with the outside world, it is named as hidden layers. Each of the perceptrons contained in one single layer is associated with each node in the subsequent layer. It can be concluded that all of the nodes are fully connected. It does not contain any visible or invisible connection between the nodes in the same layer. There are no back-loops in the feed-forward network. To minimize the prediction error, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to update the weight values. Applications: # Data Compression # Pattern Recognition # Computer Vision # Sonar Target Recognition # Speech Recognition # Handwritten Characters Recognition # 2. Recurrent Neural Network # Recurrent neural networks are yet another variation of feed-forward networks. Here each of the neurons present in the hidden layers receives an input with a specific delay in time. The Recurrent neural network mainly accesses the preceding info of existing iterations. For example, to guess the succeeding word in any sentence, one must have knowledge about the words that were previously used. It not only processes the inputs but also shares the length as well as weights crossways time. It does not let the size of the model to increase with the increase in the input size. However, the only problem with this recurrent neural network is that it has slow computational speed as well as it does not contemplate any future input for the current state. It has a problem with reminiscing prior information. Applications: # Machine Translation # Robot Control # Time Series Prediction # Speech Recognition # Speech Synthesis # Time Series Anomaly Detection # Rhythm Learning # Music Composition # 3. Convolutional Neural Network # Convolutional Neural Networks are a special kind of neural network mainly used for image classification, clustering of images and object recognition. DNNs enable unsupervised construction of hierarchical image representations. To achieve the best accuracy, deep convolutional neural networks are preferred more than any other neural network. Applications: # Identify Faces, Street Signs, Tumors. # Image Recognition. # Video Analysis. # NLP. # Anomaly Detection. # Drug Discovery. # Checkers Game. # Time Series Forecasting. # 4. Restricted Boltzmann Machine # RBMs are yet another variant of Boltzmann Machines. Here the neurons present in the input layer and the hidden layer encompasses symmetric connections amid them. However, there is no internal association within the respective layer. But in contrast to RBM, Boltzmann machines do encompass internal connections inside the hidden layer. These restrictions in BMs helps the model to train efficiently. Applications: # Filtering. # Feature Learning. # Classification. # Risk Detection. # Business and Economic analysis. # 5. Autoencoders # An autoencoder neural network is another kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Here the number of hidden cells is merely small than that of the input cells. But the number of input cells is equivalent to the number of output cells. An autoencoder network is trained to display the output similar to the fed input to force AEs to find common patterns and generalize the data. The autoencoders are mainly used for the smaller representation of the input. It helps in the reconstruction of the original data from compressed data. This algorithm is comparatively simple as it only necessitates the output identical to the input. Encoder: Convert input data in lower dimensions. Decoder: Reconstruct the compressed data. Applications: # Classification. # Clustering. # Feature Compression. # Deep learning applications # Self-Driving Cars In self-driven cars, it is able to capture the images around it by processing a huge amount of data, and then it will decide which actions should be incorporated to take a left or right or should it stop. So, accordingly, it will decide what actions it should take, which will further reduce the accidents that happen every year. Voice Controlled Assistance When we talk about voice control assistance, then Siri is the one thing that comes into our mind. So, you can tell Siri whatever you want it to do it for you, and it will search it for you and display it for you. Automatic Image Caption Generation Whatever image that you upload, the algorithm will work in such a way that it will generate caption accordingly. If you say blue colored eye, it will display a blue-colored eye with a caption at the bottom of the image. Automatic Machine Translation With the help of automatic machine translation, we are able to convert one language into another with the help of deep learning. Limitations It only learns through the observations. It comprises of biases issues. Advantages It lessens the need for feature engineering. It eradicates all those costs that are needless. It easily identifies difficult defects. It results in the best-in-class performance on problems. Disadvantages It requires an ample amount of data. It is quite expensive to train. It does not have strong theoretical groundwork. Introduction # Brains biological network provides basis for connecting elements in a real-life scenario for information processing and insight generation. A hierarchy of neurons connected through layers, where the output of one layer becomes the input for another layers, the information passes from one layer to another layer as weights. The weights associated with each neuron contain insights so that recognition and reasoning becomes easier for the next level. Artificial neural network is a very popular and effective method that consists of layers associated with weights. The association between different layers is governed by mathematical equation that passes information from one layer to the other. A bunch of mathematical equations are at work inside one artificial neural network model. Neural Networks # Task # What is Deep Learning (DL)? # A machine learning subfield of learning representations of data. Exceptional effective at learning patterns. Deep learning algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation by using a hierarchy of multiple layers. If you provide the system tons of information, it begins to understand it and respond in useful ways. Why is DL useful? # Manually designed features are often over-specified, incomplete and take a long time to design and validate Learned Features are easy to adapt, fast to learn Deep learning provides a very flexible, (almost?) universal, learnable framework for representing world, visual and linguistic information. Can learn both unsupervised and supervised Effective end-to-end joint system learning Utilize large amounts of training data In ~ 2010 DL started outperforming other ML techniques first in speech and vision , then NLP Types of Neural Networks # Single hidden layer neural network: this is the simplest form of neural network as in this there is only one hidden layer. Multiple hidden layer neural networks: in this form more than one hidden layer will connect the input data with the output data. The complexity of calculation increases in this form as it requires more computational power to the system to process information Feed forward neural networks: in this form of neural network architecture, the information is passed one directionally from one layer to another layer; there is no iteration from the first level of learning. Back propagation neural networks: in this form of neural network there are two important steps, feed forward works in passing information from input to the hidden and from hidden to output layer and secondly it calculates error and propagate it back to the previous layers.","title":"DeepLearning overview"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/DeepLearning-overview.html#deep-learning","text":"To understand what deep learning is, we first need to understand the relationship deep learning has with machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence. At the outer most ring you have artificial intelligence (using computers to reason). One layer inside of that is machine learning. With artificial neural networks and deep learning at the center. Broadly speaking, deep learning is a more approachable name for an artificial neural network. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning refers to the depth of the network. An artificial neural network can be very shallow. Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the cerebral cortex. At the basic level is the perceptron, the mathematical representation of a biological neuron. Like in the cerebral cortex, there can be several layers of interconnected perceptrons. The first layer is the input layer. Each node in this layer takes an input, and then passes its output as the input to each node in the next layer. There are generally no connections between nodes in the same layer and the last layer produces the outputs. We call the middle part the hidden layer. These neurons have no connection to the outside (e.g. input or output) and are only activated by nodes in the previous layer. Think of deep learning as the technique for learning in neural networks that utilizes multiple layers of abstraction to solve pattern recognition problems. In the 1980s, most neural networks were a single layer due to the cost of computation and availability of data. Machine learning is considered a branch or approach of Artificial intelligence, whereas deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning. Machine learning involves computer intelligence that doesn\u2019t know the answers up front. Instead, the program will run against training data, verify the success of its attempts, and modify its approach accordingly. Machine learning typical requires a sophisticated education, spanning software engineering and computer science to statistical methods and linear algebra. There are two broad classes of machine learning methods: Supervised learning Unsupervised learning In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm uses a labeled dataset to infer the desired outcome. This takes a lot of data and time, since the data needs to be labeled by hand. Supervised learning is great for classification and regression problems. For example, let\u2019s say that we were running a company and want to determine the effect of bonuses on employee retention. If we had historical data \u2013 i.e. employee bonus amount and tenure \u2013 we could use supervised machine learning. With unsupervised learning, there aren\u2019t any predefined or corresponding answers. The goal is to figure out the hidden patterns in the data. It\u2019s usually used for clustering and associative tasks, like grouping customers by behavior. Amazon\u2019s \u201ccustomers who also bought\u2026\u201d recommendations are a type of associative task. While supervised learning can be useful, we often have to resort to unsupervised learning. Deep learning has proven to be an effective unsupervised learning technique.","title":"Deep Learning"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/DeepLearning-overview.html#why-is-deep-learning-important","text":"Computers have long had techniques for recognizing features inside of images.

It\u2019s not just a marginal improvement, but a game changer: \u201cAsked whether two unfamiliar photos of faces show the same person, a human being will get it right 97.53 percent of the time.

Now for OR: OR = pd.DataFrame({'x1': (0,0,1,1), 'x2': (0,1,0,1), 'y': (0,1,1,1)}) OR x1 x2 y 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 w = np.random.randn(3)*1e-4 inputs = OR[['x1','x2']] target = OR['y'] w = train(inputs, target, w, 0.25, 20) g(np.c_[inputs, -np.ones((len(inputs), 1))], w) array([0, 1, 1, 1]) Also 100% correct. Exercise: XOR Now try running the model on the XOR function, where a one is returned for either x1 or x2 being true, but not both. What happens here? Let's explore the problem graphically: AND.plot(kind='scatter', x='x1', y='x2', c='y', s=50, colormap='winter') plt.plot(np.linspace(0,1.4), 1.5 - 1*np.linspace(0,1.4), 'k--'); XOR = pd.DataFrame({'x1': (0,0,1,1), 'x2': (0,1,0,1), 'y': (0,1,1,0)}) XOR.plot(kind='scatter', x='x1', y='x2', c='y', s=50, colormap='winter');","title":"Example: Logical functions"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/DeepLearning-overview.html#multi-layer-perceptron","text":"The solution to fitting more complex (i.e. non-linear) models with neural networks is to use a more complex network that consists of more than just a single perceptron. The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply add more weights. There are two ways to add complexity: Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a recurrent network Add neurons between the input nodes and the outputs, creating an additional (\"hidden\") layer to the network, resulting in a multi-layer perceptron The latter approach is more common in applications of neural networks. How to train a multilayer network is not intuitive. Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer. However, the process for updating the weights based on the prediction error is less clear, since it is difficult to know whether to change the weights on the input layer or on the hidden layer in order to improve the prediction. Updating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a matter of: 1. moving for ward through the network , calculating outputs given input s and current weight estimates 2. moving backward updating weights according to the resulting error from for ward propagation . In this sense, it is similar to a single-layer perceptron, except it has to be done twice, once for each layer.","title":"Multi-layer Perceptron"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/DeepLearning-overview.html#backpropagation","text":"Backpropagation is a method for efficiently computing the gradient of the cost function of a neural network with respect to its parameters.

It was developed by one of the Google engineers, Francois Chollet. It is made user-friendly, extensible, and modular for facilitating faster experimentation with deep neural networks. It not only supports Convolutional Networks and Recurrent Networks individually but also their combination. It cannot handle low-level computations, so it makes use of the Backend library to resolve it. The backend library act as a high-level API wrapper for the low-level API, which lets it run on TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. What makes Keras special? # Focus on user experience has always been a major part of Keras. Large adoption in the industry. It is a multi backend and supports multi-platform, which helps all the encoders come together for coding. Research community present for Keras works amazingly with the production community. Easy to grasp all concepts. It supports fast prototyping. It seamlessly runs on CPU as well as GPU. It provides the freedom to design any architecture, which then later is utilized as an API for the project. It is really very simple to get started with. Easy production of models actually makes Keras special. How Keras support the claim of being multi-backend and multi-platform? # Keras can be developed in R as well as Python, such that the code can be run with TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, or MXNet as per the requirement. Keras can be run on CPU, NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, TPU, etc. It ensures that producing models with Keras is really simple as it totally supports to run with TensorFlow serving, GPU acceleration (WebKeras, Keras.js), Android (TF, TF Lite), iOS (Native CoreML) and Raspberry Pi. Keras Backend # Keras being a model-level library helps in developing deep learning models by offering high-level building blocks. All the low-level computations such as products of Tensor, convolutions, etc. are not handled by Keras itself, rather they depend on a specialized tensor manipulation library that is well optimized to serve as a backend engine. Keras has managed it so perfectly that instead of incorporating one single library of tensor and performing operations related to that particular library, it offers plugging of different backend engines into Keras. Keras consist of three backend engines, which are as follows: TensorFlow TensorFlow is a Google product, which is one of the most famous deep learning tools widely used in the research area of machine learning and deep neural network. It came into the market on 9th November 2015 under the Apache License 2.0. It is built in such a way that it can easily run on multiple CPUs and GPUs as well as on mobile operating systems. It consists of various wrappers in distinct languages such as Java, C++, or Python. Theano Theano was developed at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, by the MILA group. It is an open-source python library that is widely used for performing mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays by incorporating scipy and numpy. It utilizes GPUs for faster computation and efficiently computes the gradients by building symbolic graphs automatically. It has come out to be very suitable for unstable expressions, as it first observes them numerically and then computes them with more stable algorithms. CNTK Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is deep learning's open-source framework. It consists of all the basic building blocks, which are required to form a neural network. The models are trained using C++ or Python, but it incorporates C# or Java to load the model for making predictions. Advantages of Keras # Keras encompasses the following advantages, which are as follows: It is very easy to understand and incorporate the faster deployment of network models. It has huge community support in the market as most of the AI companies are keen on using it. It supports multi backend, which means you can use any one of them among TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano with Keras as a backend according to your requirement. Since it has an easy deployment, it also holds support for cross-platform. Following are the devices on which Keras can be deployed: iOS with CoreML Android with TensorFlow Android Web browser with .js support Cloud engine Raspberry pi It supports Data parallelism, which means Keras can be trained on multiple GPU's at an instance for speeding up the training time and processing a huge amount of data. Disadvantages of Keras # The only disadvantage is that Keras has its own pre-configured layers, and if you want to create an abstract layer, it won't let you because it cannot handle low-level APIs. It only supports high-level API running on the top of the backend engine (TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK). #Based on the extracted code from the notebook, I'll transform the script to use Keras for defining and training a neural network that learns the AND and OR logic gates.

All the low-level computations such as products of Tensor, convolutions, etc. are not handled by Keras itself, rather they depend on a specialized tensor manipulation library that is well optimized to serve as a backend engine. Keras has managed it so perfectly that instead of incorporating one single library of tensor and performing operations related to that particular library, it offers plugging of different backend engines into Keras. Keras consist of three backend engines, which are as follows: TensorFlow TensorFlow is a Google product, which is one of the most famous deep learning tools widely used in the research area of machine learning and deep neural network. It came into the market on 9th November 2015 under the Apache License 2.0. It is built in such a way that it can easily run on multiple CPUs and GPUs as well as on mobile operating systems. It consists of various wrappers in distinct languages such as Java, C++, or Python. Theano Theano was developed at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, by the MILA group. It is an open-source python library that is widely used for performing mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays by incorporating scipy and numpy. It utilizes GPUs for faster computation and efficiently computes the gradients by building symbolic graphs automatically. It has come out to be very suitable for unstable expressions, as it first observes them numerically and then computes them with more stable algorithms. CNTK Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is deep learning's open-source framework. It consists of all the basic building blocks, which are required to form a neural network.

Contrast this with a classification problem, where the aim is to select a class from a list of classes (for example, where a picture contains an apple or an orange, recognizing which fruit is in the picture). This tutorial uses the classic Auto MPG dataset and demonstrates how to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, you will provide the models with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight. # Use seaborn for pairplot . !pip install -q seaborn import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns # Make NumPy printouts easier to read. np . set_printoptions ( precision = 3 , suppress = True ) import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras from tensorflow.keras import layers print ( tf . __version__ ) The Auto MPG dataset # The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ Get the data First download and import the dataset using pandas: url = 'http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data' column_names = ['MPG', 'Cylinders', 'Displacement', 'Horsepower', 'Weight', 'Acceleration', 'Model Year', 'Origin'] raw_dataset = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names, na_values='?', comment='\\t', sep=' ', skipinitialspace=True) dataset = raw_dataset.copy() dataset.tail() Clean the data The dataset contains a few unknown values: dataset.isna().sum() Drop those rows to keep this initial tutorial simple: dataset = dataset.dropna() The \"Origin\" column is categorical, not numeric.

This label is the value that you will train the model to predict. train_features = train_dataset.copy() test_features = test_dataset.copy() train_labels = train_features.pop('MPG') test_labels = test_features.pop('MPG') Normalization In the table of statistics it's easy to see how different the ranges of each feature are: train_dataset.describe().transpose()[['mean', 'std']] It is good practice to normalize features that use different scales and ranges. One reason this is important is because the features are multiplied by the model weights. So, the scale of the outputs and the scale of the gradients are affected by the scale of the inputs. Although a model might converge without feature normalization, normalization makes training much more stable. Note: There is no advantage to normalizing the one-hot features\u2014it is done here for simplicity. For more details on how to use the preprocessing layers, refer to the Working with preprocessing layers guide and the Classify structured data using Keras preprocessing layers tutorial. The Normalization layer The tf.keras.layers.Normalization is a clean and simple way to add feature normalization into your model. The first step is to create the layer: normalizer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1) Then, fit the state of the preprocessing layer to the data by calling Normalization.adapt: normalizer.adapt(np.array(train_features)) Calculate the mean and variance, and store them in the layer: print(normalizer.mean.numpy()) When the layer is called, it returns the input data, with each feature independently normalized: first = np.array(train_features[:1]) with np.printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True): print('First example:', first) print() print('Normalized:', normalizer(first).numpy()) Linear regression # Before building a deep neural network model, start with linear regression using one and several variables. Linear regression with one variable Begin with a single-variable linear regression to predict 'MPG' from 'Horsepower'. Training a model with tf.keras typically starts by defining the model architecture. Use a tf.keras.Sequential model, which represents a sequence of steps. There are two steps in your single-variable linear regression model: Normalize the 'Horsepower' input features using the tf.keras.layers.Normalization preprocessing layer. Apply a linear transformation () to produce 1 output using a linear layer (tf.keras.layers.Dense). The number of inputs can either be set by the input_shape argument, or automatically when the model is run for the first time. First, create a NumPy array made of the 'Horsepower' features. Then, instantiate the tf.keras.layers.Normalization and fit its state to the horsepower data: horsepower = np.array(train_features['Horsepower']) horsepower_normalizer = layers.Normalization(input_shape=[1,], axis=None) horsepower_normalizer.adapt(horsepower) Build the Keras Sequential model: horsepower_model = tf.keras.Sequential([ horsepower_normalizer, layers.Dense(units=1) ]) horsepower_model.summary() This model will predict 'MPG' from 'Horsepower' Run the untrained model on the first 10 'Horsepower' values. The output won't be good, but notice that it has the expected shape of (10, 1): Once the model is built, configure the training procedure using the Keras Model.compile method. The most important arguments to compile are the loss and the optimizer, since these define what will be optimized (mean_absolute_error) and how (using the tf.keras.optimizers.Adam). horsepower_model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1), loss='mean_absolute_error') Use Keras Model.fit to execute the training for 100 epochs: %%time history = horsepower_model . fit ( train_features [ 'Horsepower' ], train_labels , epochs = 100 , # Suppress logging . verbose = 0 , # Calculate validation results on 20 % of the training data. validation_split = 0.2 ) Visualize the model's training progress using the stats stored in the history object: hist = pd.DataFrame(history.history) hist['epoch'] = history.epoch hist.tail() def plot_loss ( history ) : plt . plot ( history . history [ 'loss' ] , label = 'loss' ) plt . plot ( history . history [ 'val_loss' ] , label = 'val_loss' ) plt . ylim ( [ 0, 10 ] ) plt . xlabel ( 'Epoch' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Error [MPG]' ) plt . legend () plt . grid ( True ) plot_loss(history) Collect the results on the test set for later: test_results = {} test_results['horsepower_model'] = horsepower_model.evaluate( test_features['Horsepower'], test_labels, verbose=0) x = tf.linspace(0.0, 250, 251) y = horsepower_model.predict(x) def plot_horsepower(x, y): plt.scatter(train_features['Horsepower'], train_labels, label='Data') plt.plot(x, y, color='k', label='Predictions') plt.xlabel('Horsepower') plt.ylabel('MPG') plt.legend() Since this is a single variable regression, it's easy to view the model's predictions as a function of the input: def plot_horsepower(x, y): plt.scatter(train_features['Horsepower'], train_labels, label='Data') plt.plot(x, y, color='k', label='Predictions') plt.xlabel('Horsepower') plt.ylabel('MPG') plt.legend() plot_horsepower(x, y) Linear regression with multiple inputs # You can use an almost identical setup to make predictions based on multiple inputs. This model still does the same y = mx + b except that m is a matrix and x is a vector. Create a two-step Keras Sequential model again with the first layer being normalizer (tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1)) you defined earlier and adapted to the whole dataset: linear_model = tf.keras.Sequential([ normalizer, layers.Dense(units=1) ]) When you call Model.predict on a batch of inputs, it produces units=1 outputs for each example: linear_model.predict(train_features[:10]) When you call the model, its weight matrices will be built\u2014check that the kernel weights (the m in y = mx + b) have a shape (9, 1) linear_model.layers[1].kernel Configure the model with Keras Model.compile and train with Model.fit for 100 epochs: linear_model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1), loss='mean_absolute_error') %%time history = linear_model . fit ( train_features , train_labels , epochs = 100 , # Suppress logging . verbose = 0 , # Calculate validation results on 20 % of the training data. validation_split = 0.2 ) Using all the inputs in this regression model achieves a much lower training and validation error than the horsepower_model, which had one input: plot_loss(history)","title":"Tensorflow"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/Tensorflow.html#tf-version-of-the-code","text":"import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.datasets import make_regression import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD from tensorflow.keras.losses import MeanSquaredError # Generate synthetic data X , y = make_regression ( n_samples = 1000 , n_features = 10 , noise = 0.1 ) y = y . reshape ( -

The most important arguments to compile are the loss and the optimizer, since these define what will be optimized (mean_absolute_error) and how (using the tf.keras.optimizers.Adam). horsepower_model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1), loss='mean_absolute_error') Use Keras Model.fit to execute the training for 100 epochs: %%time history = horsepower_model . fit ( train_features [ 'Horsepower' ], train_labels , epochs = 100 , # Suppress logging . verbose = 0 , # Calculate validation results on 20 % of the training data. validation_split = 0.2 ) Visualize the model's training progress using the stats stored in the history object: hist = pd.DataFrame(history.history) hist['epoch'] = history.epoch hist.tail() def plot_loss ( history ) : plt . plot ( history . history [ 'loss' ] , label = 'loss' ) plt . plot ( history . history [ 'val_loss' ] , label = 'val_loss' ) plt . ylim ( [ 0, 10 ] ) plt . xlabel ( 'Epoch' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Error [MPG]' ) plt . legend () plt . grid ( True ) plot_loss(history) Collect the results on the test set for later: test_results = {} test_results['horsepower_model'] = horsepower_model.evaluate( test_features['Horsepower'], test_labels, verbose=0) x = tf.linspace(0.0, 250, 251) y = horsepower_model.predict(x) def plot_horsepower(x, y): plt.scatter(train_features['Horsepower'], train_labels, label='Data') plt.plot(x, y, color='k', label='Predictions') plt.xlabel('Horsepower') plt.ylabel('MPG') plt.legend() Since this is a single variable regression, it's easy to view the model's predictions as a function of the input: def plot_horsepower(x, y): plt.scatter(train_features['Horsepower'], train_labels, label='Data') plt.plot(x, y, color='k', label='Predictions') plt.xlabel('Horsepower') plt.ylabel('MPG') plt.legend() plot_horsepower(x, y)","title":"Linear regression"},{"location":"AIML/DeepLearning/Tensorflow.html#linear-regression-with-multiple-inputs","text":"You can use an almost identical setup to make predictions based on multiple inputs.

Ingress Controllers are responsible for routing external traffic into services within your cluster, which means directing HTTP(S) requests based on the request host or path to specific services. \\n\\n There are several types of Ingress controllers available: \\n\\n 1. NGINX: A popular choice, it's known for its high performance and stability, especially with heavy traffic loads. \\n 2. Traefik: An open-source project that offers a dynamic reverse proxy solution. \\n 3. HAProxy: Also known for its speed and robustness in handling requests, especially when dealing with SSL offloading. \\n 4. Amazon ALB Ingress Controller: For AWS users, it integrates with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to manage external access to services within an EKS cluster. \\n 5. Contour: A lightweight Ingress controller using Envoy as its data plane. \\n 6. GCE or GKE Ingress: These are specifically for Google Cloud Platform's products, and integrate with their load balancers. \\n\\n The main responsibility of the ingress controller is to provide a layer 7 routing mechanism that can distribute traffic between different services within your Kubernetes cluster based on HTTP routes. This means you define rules about how external users should access your services, without those details being exposed to them directly. \\n \" , \"done\" : true , \"done_reason\" : \"stop\" , \"context\" :[ 2042 , 417 , 274 , 20926 , 14244 , 20391 , 11 , 26696 , 254 , 20676 , 30742 , 339 , 8589 , 2008 , 11 , 6908 , 457 , 20676 , 30742 , 7958 , 11 , 285 , 340 , 885 , 3495 , 4301 , 4512 , 276 , 4531 , 8214 , 13 , 1487 , 4636 , 2223 , 13143 , 4301 , 11 , 5411 , 285 , 13936 , 4447 , 11 , 285 , 746 , 2159 , 12 , 13517 , 250 , 8214 , 4301 , 11 , 340 , 540 , 20857 , 276 , 3495 , 13 , 185 , 13518 , 3649 , 3475 , 25 , 185 , 1488 , 20667 , 852 , 245 , 716 , 31055 , 9350 , 6208 , 698 , 8888 , 1214 , 13 , 185 , 13518 , 21289 , 25 , 185 , 32 , 716 , 31055 , 9350 , 680 , 3524 , 18173 , 317 , 245 , 10653 , 5785 , 344 , 11773 , 372 , 274 , 8690 , 3853 , 408 , 327 , 3235 , 279 , 518 , 9654 , 11 , 1706 , 272 , 18125 , 7 , 50 , 8 , 9186 , 276 , 254 , 6854 , 2408 , 2842 , 331 , 6544 , 4212 , 457 , 340 , 409 , 10715 , 13 , 207 , 185 , 185 , 769 , 746 , 3061 , 11 , 359 , 6 , 82 , 833 , 245 , 3299 , 4862 , 12774 , 545 , 10184 , 5392 , 276 , 826 , 365 , 716 , 31055 , 9350 , 285 , 24729 , 365 , 254 , 6208 , 698 , 6177 , 13 , 680 , 3524 , 3458 , 20029 , 417 , 8874 , 327 , 27462 , 6659 , 9186 , 878 , 3235 , 2372 , 518 , 9654 , 11 , 585 , 2445 , 1706 , 272 , 18125 , 7 , 50 , 8 , 12443 , 2842 , 331 , 254 , 3092 , 3686 , 409 , 3076 , 276 , 3041 , 3235 , 13 , 185 , 185 , 2948 , 417 , 2961 , 4997 , 280 , 680 , 3524 , 630 , 20029 , 2315 , 25 , 185 , 185 , 16 , 13 , 461 , 16161 , 55 , 25 , 338 , 4493 , 4850 , 11 , 359 , 6 , 82 , 3174 , 327 , 891 , 1453 , 3779 , 285 , 13699 , 11 , 4386 , 365 , 6751 , 9186 , 18127 , 13 , 185 , 17 , 13 , 6726 , 811 , 1913 , 25 , 1633 , 1714 , 12 , 1905 , 2299 , 344 , 5157 , 245 , 10999 , 13322 , 15072 , 3402 , 13 , 207 , 185 , 18 , 13 , 414 , 32 , 18131 , 25 , 6067 , 3174 , 327 , 891 , 4575 , 285 , 13130 , 1457 , 279 , 14326 , 12443 , 11 , 4386 , 750 , 14029 , 365 , 25811 , 838 , 20711 , 13 , 185 , 19 , 13 , 11183 , 8855 , 33 , 680 , 3524 , 18173 , 25 , 1487 , 29182 , 4728 , 11 , 359 , 3834 , 980 , 365 , 254 , 15838 , 15748 , 9817 , 12774 , 207 , 7 , 1743 , 33 , 8 , 276 , 8800 , 6659 , 2451 , 276 , 3235 , 2372 , 274 , 426 , 17607 , 9654 , 13 , 185 , 20 , 13 , 3458 , 415 , 25 , 338 , 27395 , 680 , 3524 , 8888 , 1242 , 2344 , 85 , 1143 , 372 , 891 , 1189 , 9633 , 13 , 185 , 21 , 13 , 452 , 4402 , 409 , 452 , 7577 , 680 , 3524 , 25 , 3394 , 417 , 10184 , 327 , 5594 , 15948 , 27782 , 6 , 82 , 3888 , 11 , 285 , 24729 , 365 , 699 , 3299 , 4862 , 29664 , 13 , 185 , 185 , 546 , 1959 , 12374 , 280 , 254 , 6208 , 698 , 8888 , 317 , 276 , 2764 , 245 , 6271 , 207 , 22 , 27462 , 12379 , 344 , 482 , 27898 , 9186 , 1433 , 1442 , 3235 , 2372 , 518 , 716 , 31055 , 9350 , 9654 , 2842 , 331 , 18125 , 22168 , 13 , 997 , 2445 , 340 , 5928 , 6544 , 782 , 940 , 6659 , 4728 , 1020 , 2451 , 518 , 3235 , 11 , 1666 , 1454 , 4283 , 1430 , 14660 , 276 , 763 , 4712 , 13 , 185 ], \"total_duration\" : 3740760469 , \"load_duration\" : 8736319 , \"prompt_eval_count\" : 81 , \"prompt_eval_duration\" : 4000000 , \"eval_count\" : 353 , \"eval_duration\" : 3726000000 } %","title":"Deepseek-R1 ollama"},{"location":"AIML/FinetuneModel/Deepseek-r1-ollama.html#deepseek-r1-ollama","text":"","title":"Deepseek-R1 ollama"},{"location":"AIML/FinetuneModel/Deepseek-r1-ollama.html#model-dockerhub-link","text":"Model Dockerhub link","title":"Model Dockerhub link"},{"location":"AIML/FinetuneModel/Deepseek-r1-ollama.html#deploy-deepseek-r1-ollama-in-local-aws-eks-with-alb-ingress","text":"","title":"Deploy Deepseek-R1 ollama in local AWS EKS with ALB Ingress"},{"location":"AIML/FinetuneModel/Deepseek-r1-ollama.html#deployment","text":"deepseek-r1-deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: deepseek-r1 spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: deepseek-r1 template: metadata: labels: app: deepseek-r1 spec: containers: -

Ingress Controllers are responsible for routing external traffic into services within your cluster, which means directing HTTP(S) requests based on the request host or path to specific services. \\n\\n There are several types of Ingress controllers available: \\n\\n 1. NGINX: A popular choice, it's known for its high performance and stability, especially with heavy traffic loads. \\n 2. Traefik: An open-source project that offers a dynamic reverse proxy solution. \\n 3. HAProxy: Also known for its speed and robustness in handling requests, especially when dealing with SSL offloading. \\n 4. Amazon ALB Ingress Controller: For AWS users, it integrates with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to manage external access to services within an EKS cluster. \\n 5. Contour: A lightweight Ingress controller using Envoy as its data plane. \\n 6. GCE or GKE Ingress: These are specifically for Google Cloud Platform's products, and integrate with their load balancers. \\n\\n The main responsibility of the ingress controller is to provide a layer 7 routing mechanism that can distribute traffic between different services within your Kubernetes cluster based on HTTP routes.

The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and free of errors, as incorrect or inconsistent data can negatively impact the performance of the ML model. Professional data scientists usually invest a very large portion of their time in this step because of the belief that \u201cBetter data beats fancier algorithms\u201d . Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data preprocessing, is a crucial step in the data science pipeline that involves identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the data to improve its quality and usability. Data cleaning is essential because raw data is often noisy, incomplete, and inconsistent, which can negatively impact the accuracy and reliability of the insights derived from it. Steps to Perform Data Cleanliness # Performing data cleaning involves a systematic process to identify and rectify errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. The following are essential steps to perform data cleaning. Removal of Unwanted Observations: Identify and eliminate irrelevant or redundant observations from the dataset. The step involves scrutinizing data entries for duplicate records, irrelevant information, or data points that do not contribute meaningfully to the analysis. Removing unwanted observations streamlines the dataset, reducing noise and improving the overall quality. Fixing Structure errors: Address structural issues in the dataset, such as inconsistencies in data formats, naming conventions, or variable types. Standardize formats, correct naming discrepancies, and ensure uniformity in data representation. Fixing structure errors enhances data consistency and facilitates accurate analysis and interpretation. Managing Unwanted outliers: Identify and manage outliers, which are data points significantly deviating from the norm. Depending on the context, decide whether to remove outliers or transform them to minimize their impact on analysis. Managing outliers is crucial for obtaining more accurate and reliable insights from the data. Handling Missing Data: Devise strategies to handle missing data effectively. This may involve imputing missing values based on statistical methods, removing records with missing values, or employing advanced imputation techniques. Handling missing data ensures a more complete dataset, preventing biases and maintaining the integrity of analyses. How to Perform Data Cleanliness # Performing data cleansing involves a systematic approach to enhance the quality and reliability of a dataset. The process begins with a thorough understanding of the data, inspecting its structure and identifying issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Addressing missing data involves strategic decisions on imputation or removal, while duplicates are systematically eliminated to reduce redundancy. Managing outliers ensures that extreme values do not unduly influence analysis. Structural errors are corrected to standardize formats and variable types, promoting consistency. Throughout the process, documentation of changes is crucial for transparency and reproducibility. Iterative validation and testing confirm the effectiveness of the data cleansing steps, ultimately resulting in a refined dataset ready for meaningful analysis and insights. Python Implementation for Database Cleaning # Let\u2019s understand each step for Database Cleaning, using titanic dataset. Below are the necessary steps: Import the necessary libraries Load the dataset Check the data information using df.info() import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Load the dataset df = pd . read_csv ( 'titanic.csv' ) df . head () Data Inspection and Exploration # Let\u2019s first understand the data by inspecting its structure and identifying missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies and check the duplicate rows with below python code: df.duplicated() Check the data information using df.info() # df.info() From the above data info, we can see that Age and Cabin have an unequal number of counts . And some of the columns are categorical and have data type objects and some are integer and float values. Check the Categorical and Numerical Columns. # # Categorical columns cat_col = [ col for col in df.columns if df[col ] . dtype == 'object' ] print ( 'Categorical columns :' , cat_col ) # Numerical columns num_col = [ col for col in df.columns if df[col ] . dtype != 'object' ] print ( 'Numerical columns :' , num_col ) Check the total number of Unique Values in the Categorical Columns # df [ cat_col ] . nunique () Removal of all Above Unwanted Observations # This includes deleting duplicate/ redundant or irrelevant values from your dataset. Duplicate observations most frequently arise during data collection and Irrelevant observations are those that don\u2019t actually fit the specific problem that you\u2019re trying to solve. Redundant observations alter the efficiency to a great extent as the data repeats and may add towards the correct side or towards the incorrect side, thereby producing unfaithful results. Irrelevant observations are any type of data that is of no use to us and can be removed directly. Now we have to make a decision according to the subject of analysis, which factor is important for our discussion. As we know our machines don\u2019t understand the text data. So, we have to either drop or convert the categorical column values into numerical types. Here we are dropping the Name columns because the Name will be always unique and it hasn\u2019t a great influence on target variables. For the ticket, Let\u2019s first print the 50 unique tickets. df['Ticket'].unique()[:50] From the above tickets, we can observe that it is made of two like first values \u2018A/5 21171\u2019 is joint from of \u2018A/5\u2019 and \u201821171\u2019 this may influence our target variables. It will the case of Feature Engineering . where we derived new features from a column or a group of columns. In the current case, we are dropping the \u201cName\u201d and \u201cTicket\u201d columns. Drop Name and Ticket Columns # df1 = df.drop(columns=['Name','Ticket']) df1.shape Handling Missing Data # Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets, and it can occur due to various reasons such as human errors, system failures, or data collection issues. Various techniques can be used to handle missing data, such as imputation, deletion, or substitution. Let\u2019s check the % missing values columns-wise for each row using df.isnull() it checks whether the values are null or not and gives returns boolean values. and .sum() will sum the total number of null values rows and we divide it by the total number of rows present in the dataset then we multiply to get values in % i.e per 100 values how much values are null. round((df1.isnull().sum()/df1.shape[0])*100,2) We cannot just ignore or remove the missing observation. They must be handled carefully as they can be an indication of something important. The two most common ways to deal with missing data are: Dropping Observations with missing values. The fact that the value was missing may be informative in itself. Plus, in the real world, you often need to make predictions on new data even if some of the features are missing! As we can see from the above result that Cabin has 77% null values and Age has 19.87% and Embarked has 0.22% of null values. So, it\u2019s not a good idea to fill 77% of null values. So, we will drop the Cabin column. Embarked column has only 0.22% of null values so, we drop the null values rows of Embarked column. df2 = df1.drop(columns='Cabin') df2.dropna(subset=['Embarked'], axis=0, inplace=True) df2.shape Imputing the missing values from past observations. Again, \u201cmissingness\u201d is almost always informative in itself, and you should tell your algorithm if a value was missing. Even if you build a model to impute your values, you\u2019re not adding any real information. You\u2019re just reinforcing the patterns already provided by other features. We can use Mean imputation or Median imputations for the case. **Note: ** Mean imputation is suitable when the data is normally distributed and has no extreme outliers. Median imputation is preferable when the data contains outliers or is skewed. # Mean imputation df3 = df2.fillna(df2.Age.mean()) # Let's check the null values again df3.isnull().sum() Handling Outliers # Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. They can negatively impact the analysis and model performance. Techniques such as clustering, interpolation, or transformation can be used to handle outliers. To check the outliers, We generally use a box plot. A box plot, also referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of a dataset\u2019s distribution. It shows a variable\u2019s median, quartiles, and potential outliers. The line inside the box denotes the median, while the box itself denotes the interquartile range (IQR). The whiskers extend to the most extreme non-outlier values within 1.5 times the IQR. Individual points beyond the whiskers are considered potential outliers. A box plot offers an easy-to-understand overview of the range of the data and makes it possible to identify outliers or skewness in the distribution. Let\u2019s plot the box plot for Age column data. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt . boxplot ( df3 [ 'Age' ], vert = False ) plt . ylabel ( 'Variable' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Age' ) plt . title ( 'Box Plot' ) plt . show () As we can see from the above Box and whisker plot, Our age dataset has outliers values. The values less than 5 and more than 55 are outliers. # calculate summary statistics mean = df3['Age'].mean() std = df3['Age'].std() # Calculate the lower and upper bounds lower_bound = mean - std*2 upper_bound = mean + std*2 print('Lower Bound :',lower_bound) print('Upper Bound :',upper_bound) # Drop the outliers df4 = df3[(df3['Age'] >= lower_bound) & (df3['Age'] <= upper_bound)] Similarly, we can remove the outliers of the remaining columns. Data Transformation # Data transformation involves converting the data from one form to another to make it more suitable for analysis. Techniques such as normalization, scaling, or encoding can be used to transform the data. Data validation and verification Data validation and verification involve ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent by comparing it with external sources or expert knowledge. For the machine learning prediction, First, we separate independent and target features. Here we will consider only \u2018Sex\u2019 \u2018Age\u2019 \u2018SibSp\u2019, \u2018Parch\u2019 \u2018Fare\u2019 \u2018Embarked\u2019 only as the independent features and Survived as target variables. Because PassengerId will not affect the survival rate. X = df3[['Pclass','Sex','Age', 'SibSp','Parch','Fare','Embarked']] Y = df3['Survived'] Data formatting Data formatting involves converting the data into a standard format or structure that can be easily processed by the algorithms or models used for analysis. Here we will discuss commonly used data formatting techniques i.e. Scaling and Normalization. Scaling - Scaling involves transforming the values of features to a specific range . It maintains the shape of the original distribution while changing the scale . - Particularly useful when features have different scales , and certain algorithms are sensitive to the magnitude of the features . - Common scaling methods include Min - Max scaling and Standardization ( Z - score scaling ) . Min-Max Scaling: Min-Max scaling rescales the values to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. It preserves the original distribution and ensures that the minimum value maps to 0 and the maximum value maps to 1. from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler # initialising the MinMaxScaler scaler = MinMaxScaler ( feature_range = ( 0 , 1 )) # Numerical columns num_col_ = [ col for col in X . columns if X [ col ] . dtype != 'object' ] x1 = X # learning the statistical parameters for each of the data and transforming x1 [ num_col_ ] = scaler . fit_transform ( x1 [ num_col_ ]) x1 . head () Standardization (Z-score scaling): Standardization transforms the values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It centers the data around the mean and scales it based on the standard deviation. Standardization makes the data more suitable for algorithms that assume a Gaussian distribution or require features to have zero mean and unit variance. Where, - X = Data - \u03bc = Mean value of X - \u03c3 = Standard deviation of X Data Cleansing Tools # Some data cleansing tools: OpenRefine Trifacta Wrangler TIBCO Clarity Cloudingo IBM Infosphere Quality Stage Advantages of Data Cleaning in Machine Learning: Improved model performance: Removal of errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data, helps the model to better learn from the data.

Removing unwanted observations streamlines the dataset, reducing noise and improving the overall quality. Fixing Structure errors: Address structural issues in the dataset, such as inconsistencies in data formats, naming conventions, or variable types. Standardize formats, correct naming discrepancies, and ensure uniformity in data representation. Fixing structure errors enhances data consistency and facilitates accurate analysis and interpretation. Managing Unwanted outliers: Identify and manage outliers, which are data points significantly deviating from the norm. Depending on the context, decide whether to remove outliers or transform them to minimize their impact on analysis. Managing outliers is crucial for obtaining more accurate and reliable insights from the data. Handling Missing Data: Devise strategies to handle missing data effectively.

It is performed during the data pre-processing to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units. If feature scaling is not done, then a machine learning algorithm tends to weigh greater values, higher and consider smaller values as the lower values, regardless of the unit of the values. Why use Feature Scaling? # In machine learning, feature scaling is employed for a number of purposes: Scaling guarantees that all features are on a comparable scale and have comparable ranges. This process is known as feature normalisation. This is significant because the magnitude of the features has an impact on many machine learning techniques. Larger scale features may dominate the learning process and have an excessive impact on the outcomes. You can avoid this problem and make sure that each feature contributes equally to the learning process by scaling the features. Algorithm performance improvement: When the features are scaled, several machine learning methods, including gradient descent-based algorithms, distance-based algorithms (such k-nearest neighbours), and support vector machines, perform better or converge more quickly. The algorithm\u2019s performance can be enhanced by scaling the features, which can hasten the convergence of the algorithm to the ideal outcome. Preventing numerical instability: Numerical instability can be prevented by avoiding significant scale disparities between features. Examples include distance calculations or matrix operations, where having features with radically differing scales can result in numerical overflow or underflow problems. Stable computations are ensured and these issues are mitigated by scaling the features. Scaling features makes ensuring that each characteristic is given the same consideration during the learning process. Without scaling, bigger scale features could dominate the learning, producing skewed outcomes. This bias is removed through scaling, which also guarantees that each feature contributes fairly to model predictions.

Step 5: Feature Engineering and Selection # Feature engineering takes center stage as a transformative process that elevates raw data into meaningful predictors. Simultaneously, feature selection refines this pool of variables, identifying the most relevant ones to enhance model efficiency and effectiveness. Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to better capture patterns and relationships within the data. This creative process requires domain expertise and a deep understanding of the problem at hand, ensuring that the engineered features contribute meaningfully to the predictive power of the model. On the other hand, feature selection focuses on identifying the subset of features that most significantly impact the model's performance. This dual approach seeks to strike a delicate balance, optimizing the feature set for predictive accuracy while minimizing computational complexity. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to better capture patterns and relationships. Feature Selection: Identify the subset of features that most significantly impact the model's performance. Domain Expertise: Leverage domain knowledge to engineer features that contribute meaningfully to predictive power. Optimization: Balance feature set for predictive accuracy while minimizing computational complexity. Step 6: Model Selection # Navigating the machine learning lifecycle requires the judicious selection of a model that aligns with the defined problem and the characteristics of the dataset. Model selection is a pivotal decision that determines the algorithmic framework guiding the predictive capabilities of the machine learning solution. The choice depends on the nature of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the desired outcomes. Here are the basic features of Model Selection: Alignment: Select a model that aligns with the defined problem and characteristics of the dataset. Complexity: Consider the complexity of the problem and the nature of the data when choosing a model. Decision Factors: Evaluate factors like performance, interpretability, and scalability when selecting a model. Experimentation: Experiment with different models to find the best fit for the problem at hand. Step 7: Model Training # With the selected model in place, the machine learning lifecycle advances to the transformative phase of model training. This process involves exposing the model to historical data, allowing it to learn patterns, relationships, and dependencies within the dataset. Model training is an iterative and dynamic journey, where the algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize errors and enhance predictive accuracy. During this phase, the model fine-tunes its understanding of the data, optimizing its ability to make meaningful predictions. Rigorous validation processes ensure that the trained model generalizes well to new, unseen data, establishing a foundation for reliable predictions in real-world scenarios. Here are the basic features of Model Training: Training Data: Expose the model to historical data to learn patterns, relationships, and dependencies. Iterative Process: Train the model iteratively, adjusting parameters to minimize errors and enhance accuracy. Optimization: Fine-tune the model's understanding of the data to optimize predictive capabilities. Validation: Rigorously validate the trained model to ensure generalization to new, unseen data. Step 8: Model Evaluation and Tuning # Model evaluation involves rigorous testing against validation datasets, employing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to gauge its effectiveness. Evaluation is a critical checkpoint, providing insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses. If the model falls short of desired performance levels, practitioners initiate model tuning\u2014a process that involves adjusting hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy. This iterative cycle of evaluation and tuning is crucial for achieving the desired level of model robustness and reliability. Here are the basic features of Model Evaluation and Tuning: Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance. Strengths and Weaknesses: Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model through rigorous testing. Iterative Improvement: Initiate model tuning to adjust hyperparameters and enhance predictive accuracy. Model Robustness: Iterate through evaluation and tuning cycles to achieve desired levels of model robustness and reliability. Step 9: Model Deployment # Upon successful evaluation, the machine learning model transitions from development to real-world application through the deployment phase. Model deployment involves integrating the predictive solution into existing systems or processes, allowing stakeholders to leverage its insights for informed decision-making. Model deployment marks the culmination of the machine learning lifecycle, transforming theoretical insights into practical solutions that drive tangible value for organizations.

Utility tools like ChatPDF have been popular Generative AI tools. The PDF document is connected as an external data source and we can interact with it as we are assisted by an LLM. What we do in RAG is inserting additional data into the context (prompt) of a model at inference time. That helps the LLM get more precise and relevant content for our queries when compared to zero-shot prompting. Another way of looking at it is in the context of a doctor and patient. A doctor\u2019s diagnosis can be significantly more precise and accurate when they have access to the patient\u2019s test results and charts, as opposed to relying solely on symptomatic observations. The workflow of the RAG based LLM application will be as follows: Receive query from the user. Convert it to an embedded query vector preserving the semantics, using an embedding model. Retrieve the top-k relevant content from the vector database by computing similarity between the query embedding and the content embedding in the database. Pass the retrieved content and query as a prompt to an LLM. The LLM gives the required response.

This will display a list of all mounted file systems and their usage in percentage . The application that is using the most disk space should be identified and the team should then take steps to free up space for that application . One possible solution is to increase the SKU size for the application by running the command `sudoedit /etc/systemd/multi- user/sockets.d/skusize` and updating the value of `SKU_SIZE` to a larger value . This will allow the application to use more disk space without running out of space . Another solution is to clean up any unnecessary files or data that are taking up space on the system by using the command `gzip -d <filename>` to decompress files and then removing them with the command `rm <filename>` . This will free up space on the disk without affecting the application 's functionality.

Utility tools like ChatPDF have been popular Generative AI tools. The PDF document is connected as an external data source and we can interact with it as we are assisted by an LLM. What we do in RAG is inserting additional data into the context (prompt) of a model at inference time. That helps the LLM get more precise and relevant content for our queries when compared to zero-shot prompting. Another way of looking at it is in the context of a doctor and patient. A doctor\u2019s diagnosis can be significantly more precise and accurate when they have access to the patient\u2019s test results and charts, as opposed to relying solely on symptomatic observations. The workflow of the RAG based LLM application will be as follows: Receive query from the user. Convert it to an embedded query vector preserving the semantics, using an embedding model. Retrieve the top-k relevant content from the vector database by computing similarity between the query embedding and the content embedding in the database. Pass the retrieved content and query as a prompt to an LLM. The LLM gives the required response.

This will display a list of all mounted file systems and their usage in percentage . The application that is using the most disk space should be identified and the team should then take steps to free up space for that application . One possible solution is to increase the SKU size for the application by running the command `sudoedit /etc/systemd/multi- user/sockets.d/skusize` and updating the value of `SKU_SIZE` to a larger value . This will allow the application to use more disk space without running out of space . Another solution is to clean up any unnecessary files or data that are taking up space on the system by using the command `gzip -d <filename>` to decompress files and then removing them with the command `rm <filename>` . This will free up space on the disk without affecting the application 's functionality.

Vector databases are especially useful for handling data from applications in AI and machine learning, particularly in tasks involving similarity search and recommendation engines. A Vector Database, at its essence, is a relational database system specifically designed to process vectorized data. Unlike conventional databases that contain information in tables, rows, and columns, vector databases work with vectors\u2013arrays of numerical values that signify points in multidimensional space. Vectors, in turn, are everywhere and are commonly used in, for instance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, genomics, and geospatial analysis. At these datasets, there are frequently high-dimensional vectors where each dimension represents a particular attribute or feature. Such data place a heavy burden on traditional databases as they are tabular in form and do not allow efficiency in the storage and retrieval of such data and there comes the bottleneck in the performance of the database. What is a Vector? # Vector in the field of mathematics and data science refers to a serial arrangement of numerical values. It is a node in a many-dimensional space where one weight from each vector corresponds to a specific dimension. In the domain of vector databases, such arrays of numerical values, thus, turn into primitive concepts of information, making it possible for the store and processing of data in high dimensions. How Vector Databases Work? # Vector Database is a type of database that is used in various machine learning use cases. They are specialized for the storage and retrieval of vector data. What are embeddings? Embedding is a data like words that have been converted into an array of numbers known as a vector that contains patterns of relationships the combination of these numbers that make up the vector act as a multi-dimensional map to measure similarity. The combination of these numbers that make up the vector act as a multi-dimensional map to measure similarity. Let\u2019s see an example describe a 2d graph the words dog and puppy are often used in similar situations. So in a word embedding they would be represented by vectors that are close together. Well this is a simple 2D example of a single dimension in reality the vector has hundreds of Dimensions that cover the rich multi-dimensional complex relationship between words. Example Images can also be turned into vectors. Google does similar images searches and the image sections are broken down into arrays of numbers allowing you to find patterns of similarity for those with closely resembling vectors. Once an embedding is created it can be stored in a database and a database full of these is considered as a vector database. Vector database can be used in several ways, searching where results are ranked by relevance to a query string or clustering where text strings are grouped by similarity and recommendations where items with related text strings are recommended also classification where text strings are classified by their most similar label. Key Components of Vector Databases # Embedding Storage: Stores high-dimensional vectors. Indexing and Search: Uses specialized indexing techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) or FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast similarity search across massive vector datasets. Scalability: Optimized for handling millions to billions of vectors. Metadata Support: Allows for filtering and adding metadata alongside vectors for refined search capabilities. Popular Use Cases # Semantic Search: Finds documents, images, or videos similar in meaning to a search query, even if they don\u2019t share keywords. Recommendation Systems: Suggests items similar to user preferences (like items with similar vector embeddings). Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers in datasets, as anomalies often have unique embeddings.

For example, a classification algorithm could be used to predict whether an email is spam or not. Machine Learning for classification # Classification is a process of categorizing data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes. Machine Learning classification is a type of supervised learning technique where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the class or category of new, unseen data. The main objective of classification machine learning is to build a model that can accurately assign a label or category to a new observation based on its features. For example, a classification model might be trained on a dataset of images labeled as either dogs or cats and then used to predict the class of new, unseen images of dogs or cats based on their features such as color, texture, and shape. Classification Types # There are two main classification types in machine learning: Binary Classification In binary classification, the goal is to classify the input into one of two classes or categories. Example \u2013 On the basis of the given health conditions of a person, we have to determine whether the person has a certain disease or not. Multiclass Classification In multi-class classification, the goal is to classify the input into one of several classes or categories. For Example \u2013 On the basis of data about different species of flowers, we have to determine which specie our observation belongs to. Other categories of classification involves: Multi-Label Classification In, Multi-label Classification the goal is to predict which of several labels a new data point belongs to. This is different from multiclass classification, where each data point can only belong to one class. For example, a multi-label classification algorithm could be used to classify images of animals as belonging to one or more of the categories cat, dog, bird, or fish. Imbalanced Classification In, Imbalanced Classification the goal is to predict whether a new data point belongs to a minority class, even though there are many more examples of the majority class. For example, a medical diagnosis algorithm could be used to predict whether a patient has a rare disease, even though there are many more patients with common diseases. Classification Algorithms # There are various types of classifiers algorithms. Some of them are : Linear Classifiers Linear models create a linear decision boundary between classes. They are simple and computationally efficient. Some of the linear classification models are as follows: Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines having kernel = \u2018linear\u2019 Single-layer Perceptron Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier Non-linear Classifiers Non-linear models create a non-linear decision boundary between classes. They can capture more complex relationships between the input features and the target variable. Some of the non-linear classification models are as follows: K-Nearest Neighbours Kernel SVM Naive Bayes Decision Tree Classification Ensemble learning classifiers: Random Forests, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, Voting Classifier, ExtraTrees Classifier Multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks Learners in Classifications Algorithm In machine learning, classification learners can also be classified as either \u201clazy\u201d or \u201ceager\u201d learners. Lazy Learners: Lazy Learners are also known as instance-based learners, lazy learners do not learn a model during the training phase. Instead, they simply store the training data and use it to classify new instances at prediction time. It is very fast at prediction time because it does not require computations during the predictions. it is less effective in high-dimensional spaces or when the number of training instances is large. Examples of lazy learners include k-nearest neighbors and case-based reasoning. Eager Learners: Eager Learners are also known as model-based learners, eager learners learn a model from the training data during the training phase and use this model to classify new instances at prediction time. It is more effective in high-dimensional spaces having large training datasets. Examples of eager learners include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. Classification Models in Machine Learning # Evaluating a classification model is an important step in machine learning, as it helps to assess the performance and generalization ability of the model on new, unseen data. There are several metrics and techniques that can be used to evaluate a classification model, depending on the specific problem and requirements. Here are some commonly used evaluation metrics: Classification Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances over the total number of instances in the test set. It is a simple and intuitive metric but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets where the majority class dominates the accuracy score. Confusion matrix: A table that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class, which can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics. Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of true positives over the total number of predicted positives, while recall measures the proportion of true positives over the total number of actual positives. These metrics are useful in scenarios where one class is more important than the other, or when there is a trade-off between false positives and false negatives. F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 x (precision x recall) / (precision + recall). It is a useful metric for imbalanced datasets where both precision and recall are important. ROC curve and AUC: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values of the classifier\u2019s decision function. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures the overall performance of the classifier, with values ranging from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1 (perfect classification). Cross-validation: A technique that divides the data into multiple folds and trains the model on each fold while testing on the others, to obtain a more robust estimate of the model\u2019s performance. It is important to choose the appropriate evaluation metric(s) based on the specific problem and requirements, and to avoid overfitting by evaluating the model on independent test data. Characteristics of Classification # Here are the characteristics of the classification: Categorical Target Variable: Classification deals with predicting categorical target variables that represent discrete classes or labels. Examples include classifying emails as spam or not spam, predicting whether a patient has a high risk of heart disease, or identifying image objects. Accuracy and Error Rates: Classification models are evaluated based on their ability to correctly classify data points. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Model Complexity: Classification models range from simple linear classifiers to more complex nonlinear models. The choice of model complexity depends on the complexity of the relationship between the input features and the target variable. Overfitting and Underfitting: Classification models are susceptible to overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data. How does Classification Machine Learning Work? # The basic idea behind classification is to train a model on a labeled dataset, where the input data is associated with their corresponding output labels, to learn the patterns and relationships between the input data and output labels. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the output labels for new unseen data. The classification process typically involves the following steps: Understanding the problem Before getting started with classification, it is important to understand the problem you are trying to solve. What are the class labels you are trying to predict? What is the relationship between the input data and the class labels? Suppose we have to predict whether a patient has a certain disease or not, on the basis of 7 independent variables, called features. This means, there can be only two possible outcomes: The patient has the disease, which means \u201cTrue\u201d. The patient has no disease. which means \u201cFalse\u201d. This is a binary classification problem. Data preparation Once you have a good understanding of the problem, the next step is to prepare your data. This includes collecting and preprocessing the data and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets. In this step, the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a format that can be used by the classification algorithm. X: It is the independent feature, in the form of an N*M matrix. N is the no. of observations and M is the number of features. y: An N vector corresponding to predicted classes for each of the N observations. Feature Extraction The relevant features or attributes are extracted from the data that can be used to differentiate between the different classes. Suppose our input X has 7 independent features, having only 5 features influencing the label or target values remaining 2 are negligibly or not correlated, then we will use only these 5 features only for the model training. Model Selection There are many different models that can be used for classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks . It is important to select a model that is appropriate for your problem, taking into account the size and complexity of your data, and the computational resources you have available. Model Training Once you have selected a model, the next step is to train it on your training data. This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to minimize the error between the predicted class labels and the actual class labels for the training data. Model Evaluation Evaluating the model: After training the model, it is important to evaluate its performance on a validation set. This will give you a good idea of how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data. Log Loss or Cross - Entropy Loss , Confusion Matrix , Precision , Recall , and AUC - ROC curve are the quality metrics used for measuring the performance of the model . Fine-tuning the model If the model\u2019s performance is not satisfactory, you can fine-tune it by adjusting the parameters, or trying a different model. Deploying the model Finally, once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can deploy it to make predictions on new data. it can be used for real world problem. Examples of Machine Learning Classification in Real Life Classification algorithms are widely used in many real-world applications across various domains, including: Email spam filtering Credit risk assessment Medical diagnosis Image classification Sentiment analysis.

Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data.","title":"Characteristics of Classification"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Classification/Classification-overview.html#how-does-classification-machine-learning-work","text":"The basic idea behind classification is to train a model on a labeled dataset, where the input data is associated with their corresponding output labels, to learn the patterns and relationships between the input data and output labels. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the output labels for new unseen data. The classification process typically involves the following steps: Understanding the problem Before getting started with classification, it is important to understand the problem you are trying to solve. What are the class labels you are trying to predict? What is the relationship between the input data and the class labels? Suppose we have to predict whether a patient has a certain disease or not, on the basis of 7 independent variables, called features. This means, there can be only two possible outcomes: The patient has the disease, which means \u201cTrue\u201d. The patient has no disease. which means \u201cFalse\u201d. This is a binary classification problem. Data preparation Once you have a good understanding of the problem, the next step is to prepare your data. This includes collecting and preprocessing the data and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets. In this step, the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a format that can be used by the classification algorithm. X: It is the independent feature, in the form of an N*M matrix. N is the no. of observations and M is the number of features. y: An N vector corresponding to predicted classes for each of the N observations. Feature Extraction The relevant features or attributes are extracted from the data that can be used to differentiate between the different classes. Suppose our input X has 7 independent features, having only 5 features influencing the label or target values remaining 2 are negligibly or not correlated, then we will use only these 5 features only for the model training. Model Selection There are many different models that can be used for classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks . It is important to select a model that is appropriate for your problem, taking into account the size and complexity of your data, and the computational resources you have available. Model Training Once you have selected a model, the next step is to train it on your training data. This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to minimize the error between the predicted class labels and the actual class labels for the training data. Model Evaluation Evaluating the model: After training the model, it is important to evaluate its performance on a validation set. This will give you a good idea of how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data. Log Loss or Cross - Entropy Loss , Confusion Matrix , Precision , Recall , and AUC - ROC curve are the quality metrics used for measuring the performance of the model . Fine-tuning the model If the model\u2019s performance is not satisfactory, you can fine-tune it by adjusting the parameters, or trying a different model. Deploying the model Finally, once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can deploy it to make predictions on new data. it can be used for real world problem.

When there is only one independent feature, it is known as Simple Linear Regression, and when there are more than one feature, it is known as Multiple Linear Regression. Similarly, when there is only one dependent variable, it is considered Univariate Linear Regression, while when there are more than one dependent variables, it is known as Multivariate Regression. Why Linear Regression is Important? # The interpretability of linear regression is a notable strength. The model\u2019s equation provides clear coefficients that elucidate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. Its simplicity is a virtue, as linear regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more complex algorithms. Linear regression is not merely a predictive tool; it forms the basis for various advanced models. Techniques like regularization and support vector machines draw inspiration from linear regression, expanding its utility. Additionally, linear regression is a cornerstone in assumption testing, enabling researchers to validate key assumptions about the data. Types of Linear Regression # There are two main types of linear regression: Simple Linear Regression This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is: where: Y is the dependent variable X is the independent variable \u03b20 is the intercept \u03b21 is the slope Multiple Linear Regression This involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is: where: Y is the dependent variable X1, X2, \u2026, Xn are the independent variables \u03b20 is the intercept \u03b21, \u03b22, \u2026, \u03b2n are the slopes The goal of the algorithm is to find the best Fit Line equation that can predict the values based on the independent variables. In regression set of records are present with X and Y values and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown X this learned function can be used. In regression we have to find the value of Y, So, a function is required that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features. What is the best Fit Line? # Our primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum. There will be the least error in the best-fit line. The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s). Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is called an independent variable also known as the predictor of Y. There are many types of functions or modules that can be used for regression. A linear function is the simplest type of function. Here, X may be a single feature or multiple features representing the problem. Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x)). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. In the figure above, X (input) is the work experience and Y (output) is the salary of a person. The regression line is the best-fit line for our model. We utilize the cost function to compute the best values in order to get the best fit line since different values for weights or the coefficient of lines result in different regression lines. Hypothesis function in Linear Regression As we have assumed earlier that our independent feature is the experience i.e X and the respective salary Y is the dependent variable. Let\u2019s assume there is a linear relationship between X and Y then the salary can be predicted using: Once we find the best \u03b81 and \u03b82 values, we get the best-fit line. So when we are finally using our model for prediction, it will predict the value of y for the input value of x. How to update \u03b81 and \u03b82 values to get the best-fit line? # Gradient Descent for Linear Regression # A linear regression model can be trained using the optimization algorithm gradient descent by iteratively modifying the model\u2019s parameters to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of the model on a training dataset. To update \u03b81 and \u03b82 values in order to reduce the Cost function (minimizing RMSE value) and achieve the best-fit line the model uses Gradient Descent. The idea is to start with random \u03b81 and \u03b82 values and then iteratively update the values, reaching minimum cost. A gradient is nothing but a derivative that defines the effects on outputs of the function with a little bit of variation in inputs. \u200b Finding the coefficients of a linear equation that best fits the training data is the objective of linear regression. By moving in the direction of the Mean Squared Error negative gradient with respect to the coefficients, the coefficients can be changed. And the respective intercept and coefficient of X will be if \u03b1 is the learning rate. Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression # Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of a variable, however, it needs to meet a few conditions in order to be accurate and dependable solutions. Linearity: The independent and dependent variables have a linear relationship with one another. This implies that changes in the dependent variable follow those in the independent variable(s) in a linear fashion. This means that there should be a straight line that can be drawn through the data points. If the relationship is not linear, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on the value of the dependent variable for another observation. If the observations are not independent, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Homoscedasticity: Across all levels of the independent variable(s), the variance of the errors is constant. This indicates that the amount of the independent variable(s) has no impact on the variance of the errors. If the variance of the residuals is not constant, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the residuals should follow a bell-shaped curve. If the residuals are not normally distributed, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression # For Multiple Linear Regression, all four of the assumptions from Simple Linear Regression apply. In addition to this, below are few more: No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation between the independent variables. This indicates that there is little or no correlation between the independent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, which can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each variable on the dependent variable. If there is multicollinearity, then multiple linear regression will not be an accurate model. Additivity: The model assumes that the effect of changes in a predictor variable on the response variable is consistent regardless of the values of the other variables. This assumption implies that there is no interaction between variables in their effects on the dependent variable. Feature Selection: In multiple linear regression, it is essential to carefully select the independent variables that will be included in the model. Including irrelevant or redundant variables may lead to overfitting and complicate the interpretation of the model. Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise or random fluctuations that do not represent the true underlying relationship between variables. This can lead to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Multicollinearity # Multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, making it difficult to assess the individual effects of each variable on the dependent variable. Detecting Multicollinearity includes two techniques: - Correlation Matrix: Examining the correlation matrix among the independent variables is a common way to detect multicollinearity. High correlations (close to 1 or -1) indicate potential multicollinearity. - VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): VIF is a measure that quantifies how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if your predictors are correlated. A high VIF (typically above 10) suggests multicollinearity. Evaluation Metrics for Linear Regression # A variety of evaluation measures can be used to determine the strength of any linear regression model. These assessment metrics often give an indication of how well the model is producing the observed outputs. The most common measurements are: Mean Square Error (MSE) Mean Squared Error (MSE) is an evaluation metric that calculates the average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values for all the data points. The difference is squared to ensure that negative and positive differences don\u2019t cancel each other out. MSE is a way to quantify the accuracy of a model\u2019s predictions. MSE is sensitive to outliers as large errors contribute significantly to the overall score. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Mean Absolute Error is an evaluation metric used to calculate the accuracy of a regression model. MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and actual values. Mathematically, MAE is expressed as: Lower MAE value indicates better model performance. It is not sensitive to the outliers as we consider absolute differences. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) The square root of the residuals\u2019 variance is the Root Mean Squared Error. It describes how well the observed data points match the expected values, or the model\u2019s absolute fit to the data.

It represents the best-fitting line that captures the overall trend of how a dependent variable (Y) changes in response to variations in an independent variable (X). Positive Linear Regression Line: A positive linear regression line indicates a direct relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). This means that as the value of X increases, the value of Y also increases. The slope of a positive linear regression line is positive, meaning that the line slants upward from left to right. Negative Linear Regression Line: A negative linear regression line indicates an inverse relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). This means that as the value of X increases, the value of Y decreases. The slope of a negative linear regression line is negative, meaning that the line slants downward from left to right. Regularization Techniques for Linear Models # Advantages & Disadvantages of Linear Regression # Advantages of Linear Regression Linear regression is a relatively simple algorithm, making it easy to understand and implement. The coefficients of the linear regression model can be interpreted as the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, providing insights into the relationships between variables. Linear regression is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets effectively. It can be trained quickly on large datasets, making it suitable for real-time applications. Linear regression is relatively robust to outliers compared to other machine learning algorithms. Outliers may have a smaller impact on the overall model performance. Linear regression often serves as a good baseline model for comparison with more complex machine learning algorithms. Linear regression is a well-established algorithm with a rich history and is widely available in various machine learning libraries and software packages. Disadvantages of Linear Regression Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. If the relationship is not linear, the model may not perform well. Linear regression is sensitive to multicollinearity, which occurs when there is a high correlation between independent variables. Multicollinearity can inflate the variance of the coefficients and lead to unstable model predictions. Linear regression assumes that the features are already in a suitable form for the model. Feature engineering may be required to transform features into a format that can be effectively used by the model. Linear regression is susceptible to both overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying relationships in the data. Linear regression provides limited explanatory power for complex relationships between variables. More advanced machine learning techniques may be necessary for deeper insights. Conclusion # Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that has been widely used for many years due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. It is a valuable tool for understanding relationships between variables and making predictions in a variety of applications. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations, such as its assumption of linearity and sensitivity to multicollinearity. When these limitations are carefully considered, linear regression can be a powerful tool for data analysis and prediction. 2.Gradient Descent in Linear Regression # What is Gradient Descent? # Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that tries to find the optimum value (Minimum/Maximum) of an objective function. It is one of the most used optimization techniques in machine learning projects for updating the parameters of a model in order to minimize a cost function. The main aim of gradient descent is to find the best parameters of a model which gives the highest accuracy on training as well as testing datasets. In gradient descent, The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function at a specific point. Moving in the opposite direction of the gradient allows the algorithm to gradually descend towards lower values of the function, and eventually reaching to the minimum of the function. Steps Required in Gradient Descent Algorithm Step 1 we first initialize the parameters of the model randomly Step 2 Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. It involves making partial differentiation of cost function with respect to the parameters. Step 3 Update the parameters of the model by taking steps in the opposite direction of the model. Here we choose a hyperparameter learning rate which is denoted by alpha. It helps in deciding the step size of the gradient. Step 4 Repeat steps 2 and 3 iteratively to get the best parameter for the defined model Pseudocode for Gradient Descent To apply this gradient descent on data using any programming language we have to make four new functions using which we can update our parameter and apply it to data to make a prediction. We will see each function one by one and understand it gradient_descent \u2013 In the gradient descent function we will make the prediction on a dataset and compute the difference between the predicted and actual target value and accordingly we will update the parameter and hence it will return the updated parameter. compute_predictions \u2013 In this function, we will compute the prediction using the parameters at each iteration. compute_gradient \u2013 In this function we will compute the error which is the difference between the actual and predicted target value and then compute the gradient using this error and training data. update_parameters \u2013 In this separate function we will update the parameter using learning rate and gradient that we got from the compute_gradient function. function gradient_descent ( X, y, learning_rate, num_iterations ): Initialize parameters = \u03b8 for iter in range ( num_iterations ): predictions = compute_predictions ( X , \u03b8 ) gradient = compute_gradient ( X , y , predictions ) update_parameters ( \u03b8 , gradient , learning_rate ) return \u03b8 function compute_predictions ( X, \u03b8 ): return X * \u03b8 function compute_gradient ( X, y, predictions ): error = predictions - y gradient = X\u1d40 * error / m return gradient function update_parameters ( \u03b8, gradient, learning_rate ): \u03b8 = \u03b8 - learning_rate \u2a09 gradient Mathematics Behind Gradient Descent In the Machine Learning Regression problem, our model targets to get the best-fit regression line to predict the value y based on the given input value (x). While training the model, the model calculates the cost function like Root Mean Squared error between the predicted value (pred) and true value (y). Our model targets to minimize this cost function. To minimize this cost function, the model needs to have the best value of \u03b81 and \u03b82(for Univariate linear regression problem). Initially model selects \u03b81 and \u03b82 values randomly and then iteratively update these value in order to minimize the cost function until it reaches the minimum. By the time model achieves the minimum cost function, it will have the best \u03b81 and \u03b82 values. Using these updated values of \u03b81 and \u03b82 in the hypothesis equation of linear equation, our model will predict the output value y. How do \u03b81 and \u03b82 values get updated? How Does Gradient Descent Work Gradient descent works by moving downward toward the pits or valleys in the graph to find the minimum value. This is achieved by taking the derivative of the cost function, as illustrated in the figure below. During each iteration, gradient descent step-downs the cost function in the direction of the steepest descent. By adjusting the parameters in this direction, it seeks to reach the minimum of the cost function and find the best-fit values for the parameters. The size of each step is determined by parameter \u03b1 known as Learning Rate. In the Gradient Descent algorithm, one can infer two points : If slope is +ve : \u03b8j = \u03b8j \u2013 (+ve value). Hence the value of \u03b8j decreases. How To Choose Learning Rate The choice of correct learning rate is very important as it ensures that Gradient Descent converges in a reasonable time. : If we choose \u03b1 to be very large, Gradient Descent can overshoot the minimum. It may fail to converge or even diverge. Python Implementation of Gradient Descent # At first, we will import all the necessary Python libraries that we will need for mathematical computation and plotting like numpy for mathematical operations and matplotlib for plotting. Then we will define a class Linear_Regression that represents the linear regression model. We will make a update_coeffs method inside the class to update the coefficients (parameters) of the linear regression model using gradient descent. To calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual output we will make a predict method that will make predictions using the current model coefficients. For updating and calculating the gradient of the error we will make compute_cost which will apply gradient descent on (mean squared error) between the predicted values and the actual values. # Implementation of gradient descent in linear regression import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt class Linear_Regression : def __init__ ( self , X , Y ): self .

Scalability: Gradient Descent is scalable to large datasets since it updates the parameters for each training example one at a time. Convergence: Gradient Descent can converge to the global minimum of the cost function, provided that the learning rate is set appropriately. Disadvantages Of Gradient Descent # Sensitivity to Learning Rate: The choice of learning rate can be critical in Gradient Descent since using a high learning rate can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum, while a low learning rate can make the algorithm converge slowly. Slow Convergence: Gradient Descent may require more iterations to converge to the minimum since it updates the parameters for each training example one at a time. Local Minima: Gradient Descent can get stuck in local minima if the cost function has multiple local minima. Noisy updates: The updates in Gradient Descent are noisy and have a high variance, which can make the optimization process less stable and lead to oscillations around the minimum. Overall, Gradient Descent is a useful optimization algorithm for linear regression, but it has some limitations and requires careful tuning of the learning rate to ensure convergence.","title":"Linear Regression"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Linear-Regression.html#linear-regression","text":"Introduction to Linear Regression Gradient Descent in Linear Regression Linear regression (Python Implementation from scratch) Linear regression implementation using sklearn Rainfall prediction - Project Boston Housing Kaggle Challenge - Project Ridge Regression Lasso regression Elastic net Regression Implementation of Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net","title":"Linear Regression"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Linear-Regression.html#1introduction-to-linear-regression","text":"","title":"1.Introduction to Linear Regression"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Linear-Regression.html#what-is-linear-regression","text":"Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s). Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is called an independent variable also known as the predictor of Y. There are many types of functions or modules that can be used for regression. A linear function is the simplest type of function. Here, X may be a single feature or multiple features representing the problem. Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x)). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. In the figure above, X (input) is the work experience and Y (output) is the salary of a person. The regression line is the best-fit line for our model. We utilize the cost function to compute the best values in order to get the best fit line since different values for weights or the coefficient of lines result in different regression lines.

Linearity: The independent and dependent variables have a linear relationship with one another. This implies that changes in the dependent variable follow those in the independent variable(s) in a linear fashion. This means that there should be a straight line that can be drawn through the data points. If the relationship is not linear, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on the value of the dependent variable for another observation. If the observations are not independent, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Homoscedasticity: Across all levels of the independent variable(s), the variance of the errors is constant. This indicates that the amount of the independent variable(s) has no impact on the variance of the errors. If the variance of the residuals is not constant, then linear regression will not be an accurate model. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the residuals should follow a bell-shaped curve.

In addition to this, below are few more: No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation between the independent variables.

Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, which can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each variable on the dependent variable. If there is multicollinearity, then multiple linear regression will not be an accurate model. Additivity: The model assumes that the effect of changes in a predictor variable on the response variable is consistent regardless of the values of the other variables. This assumption implies that there is no interaction between variables in their effects on the dependent variable. Feature Selection: In multiple linear regression, it is essential to carefully select the independent variables that will be included in the model. Including irrelevant or redundant variables may lead to overfitting and complicate the interpretation of the model.

High correlations (close to 1 or -1) indicate potential multicollinearity. - VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): VIF is a measure that quantifies how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if your predictors are correlated.

To minimize this cost function, the model needs to have the best value of \u03b81 and \u03b82(for Univariate linear regression problem). Initially model selects \u03b81 and \u03b82 values randomly and then iteratively update these value in order to minimize the cost function until it reaches the minimum. By the time model achieves the minimum cost function, it will have the best \u03b81 and \u03b82 values. Using these updated values of \u03b81 and \u03b82 in the hypothesis equation of linear equation, our model will predict the output value y. How do \u03b81 and \u03b82 values get updated? How Does Gradient Descent Work Gradient descent works by moving downward toward the pits or valleys in the graph to find the minimum value. This is achieved by taking the derivative of the cost function, as illustrated in the figure below. During each iteration, gradient descent step-downs the cost function in the direction of the steepest descent. By adjusting the parameters in this direction, it seeks to reach the minimum of the cost function and find the best-fit values for the parameters. The size of each step is determined by parameter \u03b1 known as Learning Rate. In the Gradient Descent algorithm, one can infer two points : If slope is +ve : \u03b8j = \u03b8j \u2013 (+ve value). Hence the value of \u03b8j decreases. How To Choose Learning Rate The choice of correct learning rate is very important as it ensures that Gradient Descent converges in a reasonable time. : If we choose \u03b1 to be very large, Gradient Descent can overshoot the minimum. It may fail to converge or even diverge.","title":"What is Gradient Descent?"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Linear-Regression.html#python-implementation-of-gradient-descent","text":"At first, we will import all the necessary Python libraries that we will need for mathematical computation and plotting like numpy for mathematical operations and matplotlib for plotting.

For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 otherwise it belongs to Class 0. It\u2019s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems. Key Points: - Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore, the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. - It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1. - In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an \u201cS\u201d shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1). Logistic Function \u2013 Sigmoid Function # The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map the predicted values to probabilities. It maps any real value into another value within a range of 0 and 1. The value of the logistic regression must be between 0 and 1, which cannot go beyond this limit, so it forms a curve like the \u201cS\u201d form. The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function. In logistic regression, we use the concept of the threshold value, which defines the probability of either 0 or 1. Such as values above the threshold value tends to 1, and a value below the threshold values tends to 0. Types of Logistic Regression # On the basis of the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types: Binomial: In binomial Logistic regression, there can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc. Multinomial: In multinomial Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as \u201ccat\u201d, \u201cdogs\u201d, or \u201csheep\u201d. Ordinal: In ordinal Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as \u201clow\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d, or \u201cHigh\u201d. Assumptions of Logistic Regression # We will explore the assumptions of logistic regression as understanding these assumptions is important to ensure that we are using appropriate application of the model. The assumption include: Independent observations: Each observation is independent of the other. meaning there is no correlation between any input variables. Binary dependent variables: It takes the assumption that the dependent variable must be binary or dichotomous, meaning it can take only two values. For more than two categories SoftMax functions are used. Linearity relationship between independent variables and log odds: The relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of the dependent variable should be linear. No outliers: There should be no outliers in the dataset. Large sample size: The sample size is sufficiently large Terminologies involved in Logistic Regression # Here are some common terms involved in logistic regression: Independent variables: The input characteristics or predictor factors applied to the dependent variable\u2019s predictions. Dependent variable: The target variable in a logistic regression model, which we are trying to predict. Logistic function: The formula used to represent how the independent and dependent variables relate to one another. The logistic function transforms the input variables into a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the dependent variable being 1 or 0. Odds: It is the ratio of something occurring to something not occurring. it is different from probability as the probability is the ratio of something occurring to everything that could possibly occur. Log-odds: The log-odds, also known as the logit function, is the natural logarithm of the odds. In logistic regression, the log odds of the dependent variable are modeled as a linear combination of the independent variables and the intercept. Coefficient: The logistic regression model\u2019s estimated parameters, show how the independent and dependent variables relate to one another. Intercept: A constant term in the logistic regression model, which represents the log odds when all independent variables are equal to zero. Maximum likelihood estimation: The method used to estimate the coefficients of the logistic regression model, which maximizes the likelihood of observing the data given the model. How does Logistic Regression work? # The logistic regression model transforms the linear regression function continuous value output into categorical value output using a sigmoid function, which maps any real-valued set of independent variables input into a value between 0 and 1. This function is known as the logistic function. Let the independent input features be: Sigmoid Function # Code Implementation for Logistic Regression # Binomial Logistic regression: Target variable can have only 2 possible types: \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d which may represent \u201cwin\u201d vs \u201closs\u201d, \u201cpass\u201d vs \u201cfail\u201d, \u201cdead\u201d vs \u201calive\u201d, etc., in this case, sigmoid functions are used, which is already discussed above.

The setting of the threshold value is a very important aspect of Logistic regression and is dependent on the classification problem itself. The decision for the value of the threshold value is majorly affected by the values of precision and recall. Ideally, we want both precision and recall being 1, but this seldom is the case. In the case of a Precision-Recall tradeoff, we use the following arguments to decide upon the threshold: Low Precision/High Recall: In applications where we want to reduce the number of false negatives without necessarily reducing the number of false positives, we choose a decision value that has a low value of Precision or a high value of Recall. For example, in a cancer diagnosis application, we do not want any affected patient to be classified as not affected without giving much heed to if the patient is being wrongfully diagnosed with cancer. This is because the absence of cancer can be detected by further medical diseases, but the presence of the disease cannot be detected in an already rejected candidate. High Precision/Low Recall: In applications where we want to reduce the number of false positives without necessarily reducing the number of false negatives, we choose a decision value that has a high value of Precision or a low value of Recall. For example, if we are classifying customers whether they will react positively or negatively to a personalized advertisement, we want to be absolutely sure that the customer will react positively to the advertisement because otherwise, a negative reaction can cause a loss of potential sales from the customer.","title":"Logistic Regression"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Logistic-Regression.html#logistic-regression","text":"","title":"Logistic Regression"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Logistic-Regression.html#what-is-logistic-regression","text":"Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.

The article delves into regression in machine learning, elucidating models, terminologies, types, and practical applications. What is Regression? # Regression is a statistical approach used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one or more independent variables (predictor variables). The objective is to determine the most suitable function that characterizes the connection between these variables. It seeks to find the best-fitting model, which can be utilized to make predictions or draw conclusions. Regression in Machine Learning # It is a supervised machine learning technique, used to predict the value of the dependent variable for new, unseen data. It models the relationship between the input features and the target variable, allowing for the estimation or prediction of numerical values. Regression analysis problem works with if output variable is a real or continuous value, such as \u201csalary\u201d or \u201cweight\u201d. Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points. Terminologies Related to the Regression Analysis in Machine Learning Terminologies Related to Regression Analysis: Response Variable: The primary factor to predict or understand in regression, also known as the dependent variable or target variable. Predictor Variable: Factors influencing the response variable, used to predict its values; also called independent variables. Outliers: Observations with significantly low or high values compared to others, potentially impacting results and best avoided. Multicollinearity: High correlation among independent variables, which can complicate the ranking of influential variables. Underfitting and Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when an algorithm performs well on training but poorly on testing, while underfitting indicates poor performance on both datasets. Regression Types There are two main types of regression: Simple Regression Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on a single independent variable. Simple linear regression should be used when there is only a single independent variable. Multiple Regression Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. Multiple linear regression should be used when there are multiple independent variables. NonLinear Regression Relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable(s) follows a nonlinear pattern. Provides flexibility in modeling a wide range of functional forms. Regression Algorithms # There are many different types of regression algorithms, but some of the most common include: Linear Regression Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical models. This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. Polynomial Regression Polynomial regression is used to model nonlinear relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables. It adds polynomial terms to the linear regression model to capture more complex relationships. Support Vector Regression (SVR) Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of regression algorithm that is based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a type of algorithm that is used for classification tasks, but it can also be used for regression tasks. SVR works by finding a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. Decision Tree Regression Decision tree regression is a type of regression algorithm that builds a decision tree to predict the target value. A decision tree is a tree-like structure that consists of nodes and branches. Each node represents a decision, and each branch represents the outcome of that decision. The goal of decision tree regression is to build a tree that can accurately predict the target value for new data points. Random Forest Regression Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to predict the target value. Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning algorithm that combines multiple models to improve the performance of the overall model. Random forest regression works by building a large number of decision trees, each of which is trained on a different subset of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all of the trees. Regularized Linear Regression Techniques Ridge Regression Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that is used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. Lasso regression Lasso regression is another type of linear regression that is used to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty term to the loss function that forces the model to use some weights and to set others to zero. Characteristics of Regression # Here are the characteristics of the regression: Continuous Target Variable: Regression deals with predicting continuous target variables that represent numerical values. Examples include predicting house prices, forecasting sales figures, or estimating patient recovery times. Error Measurement: Regression models are evaluated based on their ability to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Common error metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Model Complexity: Regression models range from simple linear models to more complex nonlinear models. The choice of model complexity depends on the complexity of the relationship between the input features and the target variable. Overfitting and Underfitting: Regression models are susceptible to overfitting and underfitting. Interpretability: The interpretability of regression models varies depending on the algorithm used. Simple linear models are highly interpretable, while more complex models may be more difficult to interpret. Examples Which of the following is a regression task? Predicting age of a person Predicting nationality of a person Predicting whether stock price of a company will increase tomorrow Predicting whether a document is related to sighting of UFOs? Solution : Predicting age of a person (because it is a real value, predicting nationality is categorical, whether stock price will increase is discrete-yes/no answer, predicting whether a document is related to UFO is again discrete- a yes/no answer). Regression Model Machine Learning # Let\u2019s take an example of linear regression. We have a Housing data set and we want to predict the price of the house.

The red line indicates the best fit line for predicting the price. To make an individual prediction using the linear regression model: Regression Evaluation Metrics # Here are some most popular evaluation metrics for regression: Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the mean squared error. Huber Loss: A hybrid loss function that transitions from MAE to MSE for larger errors, providing balance between robustness and MSE\u2019s sensitivity to outliers. Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error R2 \u2013 Score: Higher values indicate better fit, ranging from 0 to 1. Applications of Regression # Predicting prices: For example, a regression model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features. Forecasting trends: For example, a regression model could be used to forecast the sales of a product based on historical sales data and economic indicators. Identifying risk factors: For example, a regression model could be used to identify risk factors for heart disease based on patient data. Making decisions: For example, a regression model could be used to recommend which investment to buy based on market data. What is regression and classification?

Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points. Terminologies Related to the Regression Analysis in Machine Learning Terminologies Related to Regression Analysis: Response Variable: The primary factor to predict or understand in regression, also known as the dependent variable or target variable. Predictor Variable: Factors influencing the response variable, used to predict its values; also called independent variables. Outliers: Observations with significantly low or high values compared to others, potentially impacting results and best avoided. Multicollinearity: High correlation among independent variables, which can complicate the ranking of influential variables. Underfitting and Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when an algorithm performs well on training but poorly on testing, while underfitting indicates poor performance on both datasets. Regression Types There are two main types of regression: Simple Regression Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on a single independent variable. Simple linear regression should be used when there is only a single independent variable. Multiple Regression Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. Multiple linear regression should be used when there are multiple independent variables. NonLinear Regression Relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable(s) follows a nonlinear pattern. Provides flexibility in modeling a wide range of functional forms.","title":"Regression in Machine Learning"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Regression-overview.html#regression-algorithms","text":"There are many different types of regression algorithms, but some of the most common include: Linear Regression Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical models. This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. Polynomial Regression Polynomial regression is used to model nonlinear relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables. It adds polynomial terms to the linear regression model to capture more complex relationships. Support Vector Regression (SVR) Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of regression algorithm that is based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a type of algorithm that is used for classification tasks, but it can also be used for regression tasks. SVR works by finding a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. Decision Tree Regression Decision tree regression is a type of regression algorithm that builds a decision tree to predict the target value. A decision tree is a tree-like structure that consists of nodes and branches. Each node represents a decision, and each branch represents the outcome of that decision. The goal of decision tree regression is to build a tree that can accurately predict the target value for new data points. Random Forest Regression Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to predict the target value. Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning algorithm that combines multiple models to improve the performance of the overall model. Random forest regression works by building a large number of decision trees, each of which is trained on a different subset of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all of the trees. Regularized Linear Regression Techniques Ridge Regression Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that is used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. Lasso regression Lasso regression is another type of linear regression that is used to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty term to the loss function that forces the model to use some weights and to set others to zero.","title":"Regression Algorithms"},{"location":"AIML/Supervised/Regression/Regression-overview.html#characteristics-of-regression","text":"Here are the characteristics of the regression: Continuous Target Variable: Regression deals with predicting continuous target variables that represent numerical values.

This kind of data cannot be analyzed using supervised learning algorithms. We need the help of unsupervised algorithms. One of the most popular type of analysis under unsupervised learning is Cluster analysis. When the goal is to group similar data points in a dataset, then we use cluster analysis. In practical situations, we can use cluster analysis for customer segmentation for targeted advertisements, or in medical imaging to find unknown or new infected areas and many more use cases. What is Clustering ? # The task of grouping data points based on their similarity with each other is called Clustering or Cluster Analysis. This method is defined under the branch of Unsupervised Learning, which aims at gaining insights from unlabelled data points, that is, unlike supervised learning we don\u2019t have a target variable. Clustering aims at forming groups of homogeneous data points from a heterogeneous dataset. It evaluates the similarity based on a metric like Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, etc. and then group the points with highest similarity score together. For Example, In the graph given below, we can clearly see that there are 3 circular clusters forming on the basis of distance. Now it is not necessary that the clusters formed must be circular in shape. The shape of clusters can be arbitrary. There are many algortihms that work well with detecting arbitrary shaped clusters. For example, In the below given graph we can see that the clusters formed are not circular in shape. Types of Clustering # Broadly speaking, there are 2 types of clustering that can be performed to group similar data points: Hard Clustering: In this type of clustering, each data point belongs to a cluster completely or not. For example, Let\u2019s say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters. So each data point will either belong to cluster 1 or cluster 2. Soft Clustering: In this type of clustering, instead of assigning each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that point being that cluster is evaluated. For example, Let\u2019s say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters. So we will be evaluating a probability of a data point belonging to both clusters. This probability is calculated for all data points. Uses of Clustering # Now before we begin with types of clustering algorithms, we will go through the use cases of Clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are majorly used for: Market Segmentation \u2013 Businesses use clustering to group their customers and use targeted advertisements to attract more audience. Market Basket Analysis \u2013 Shop owners analyze their sales and figure out which items are majorly bought together by the customers. For example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers. Social Network Analysis \u2013 Social media sites use your data to understand your browsing behaviour and provide you with targeted friend recommendations or content recommendations. Medical Imaging \u2013 Doctors use Clustering to find out diseased areas in diagnostic images like X-rays. Anomaly Detection \u2013 To find outliers in a stream of real-time dataset or forecasting fraudulent transactions we can use clustering to identify them. Simplify working with large datasets \u2013 Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete. Now, you may reduce a feature set\u2019s whole feature set into its cluster ID. Clustering is effective when it can represent a complicated case with a straightforward cluster ID. Using the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler. There are many more use cases for clustering but there are some of the major and common use cases of clustering. Moving forward we will be discussing Clustering Algorithms that will help you perform the above tasks. Types of Clustering Algorithms # At the surface level, clustering helps in the analysis of unstructured data. Graphing, the shortest distance, and the density of the data points are a few of the elements that influence cluster formation. Clustering is the process of determining how related the objects are based on a metric called the similarity measure. Similarity metrics are easier to locate in smaller sets of features. It gets harder to create similarity measures as the number of features increases. Depending on the type of clustering algorithm being utilized in data mining, several techniques are employed to group the data from the datasets. In this part, the clustering techniques are described. Various types of clustering algorithms are: Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods) Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods) Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering) Distribution-based Clustering 1. Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods) # Partitioning methods are the most easiest clustering algorithms. They group data points on the basis of their closeness. Generally, the similarity measure chosen for these algorithms are Euclidian distance, Manhattan Distance or Minkowski Distance. The datasets are separated into a predetermined number of clusters, and each cluster is referenced by a vector of values. When compared to the vector value, the input data variable shows no difference and joins the cluster. The primary drawback for these algorithms is the requirement that we establish the number of clusters, \u201ck,\u201d either intuitively or scientifically (using the Elbow Method) before any clustering machine learning system starts allocating the data points. Despite this, it is still the most popular type of clustering. K-means and K-medoids clustering are some examples of this type clustering. 2. Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods) # Density-based clustering, a model-based method, finds groups based on the density of data points. Contrary to centroid-based clustering, which requires that the number of clusters be predefined and is sensitive to initialization, density-based clustering determines the number of clusters automatically and is less susceptible to beginning positions. They are great at handling clusters of different sizes and forms, making them ideally suited for datasets with irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters. These methods manage both dense and sparse data regions by focusing on local density and can distinguish clusters with a variety of morphologies. In contrast, centroid-based grouping, like k-means, has trouble finding arbitrary shaped clusters. Due to its preset number of cluster requirements and extreme sensitivity to the initial positioning of centroids, the outcomes can vary. Furthermore, the tendency of centroid-based approaches to produce spherical or convex clusters restricts their capacity to handle complicated or irregularly shaped clusters. In conclusion, density-based clustering overcomes the drawbacks of centroid-based techniques by autonomously choosing cluster sizes, being resilient to initialization, and successfully capturing clusters of various sizes and forms. The most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN. 3. Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering) # A method for assembling related data points into hierarchical clusters is called hierarchical clustering. Each data point is initially taken into account as a separate cluster, which is subsequently combined with the clusters that are the most similar to form one large cluster that contains all of the data points. Think about how you may arrange a collection of items based on how similar they are. Each object begins as its own cluster at the base of the tree when using hierarchical clustering, which creates a dendrogram, a tree-like structure. The closest pairings of clusters are then combined into larger clusters after the algorithm examines how similar the objects are to one another. When every object is in one cluster at the top of the tree, the merging process has finished. Exploring various granularity levels is one of the fun things about hierarchical clustering. To obtain a given number of clusters, you can select to cut the dendrogram at a particular height. The more similar two objects are within a cluster, the closer they are. It\u2019s comparable to classifying items according to their family trees, where the nearest relatives are clustered together and the wider branches signify more general connections. There are 2 approaches for Hierarchical clustering: Divisive Clustering: It follows a top-down approach, here we consider all data points to be part one big cluster and then this cluster is divide into smaller groups. Agglomerative Clustering: It follows a bottom-up approach, here we consider all data points to be part of individual clusters and then these clusters are clubbed together to make one big cluster with all data points. 4. Distribution-based Clustering # Using distribution-based clustering, data points are generated and organized according to their propensity to fall into the same probability distribution (such as a Gaussian, binomial, or other) within the data. The data elements are grouped using a probability-based distribution that is based on statistical distributions. Included are data objects that have a higher likelihood of being in the cluster. A data point is less likely to be included in a cluster the further it is from the cluster\u2019s central point, which exists in every cluster. A notable drawback of density and boundary-based approaches is the need to specify the clusters a priori for some algorithms, and primarily the definition of the cluster form for the bulk of algorithms. There must be at least one tuning or hyper-parameter selected, and while doing so should be simple, getting it wrong could have unanticipated repercussions. Distribution-based clustering has a definite advantage over proximity and centroid-based clustering approaches in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and cluster structure. The key issue is that, in order to avoid overfitting, many clustering methods only work with simulated or manufactured data, or when the bulk of the data points certainly belong to a preset distribution. The most popular distribution-based clustering algorithm is Gaussian Mixture Model.

For example, Let\u2019s say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters. So we will be evaluating a probability of a data point belonging to both clusters. This probability is calculated for all data points.","title":"Types of Clustering"},{"location":"AIML/Unsupervised/Clustering/Clustering-overview.html#uses-of-clustering","text":"Now before we begin with types of clustering algorithms, we will go through the use cases of Clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are majorly used for: Market Segmentation \u2013 Businesses use clustering to group their customers and use targeted advertisements to attract more audience. Market Basket Analysis \u2013 Shop owners analyze their sales and figure out which items are majorly bought together by the customers. For example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers. Social Network Analysis \u2013 Social media sites use your data to understand your browsing behaviour and provide you with targeted friend recommendations or content recommendations. Medical Imaging \u2013 Doctors use Clustering to find out diseased areas in diagnostic images like X-rays. Anomaly Detection \u2013 To find outliers in a stream of real-time dataset or forecasting fraudulent transactions we can use clustering to identify them. Simplify working with large datasets \u2013 Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete. Now, you may reduce a feature set\u2019s whole feature set into its cluster ID. Clustering is effective when it can represent a complicated case with a straightforward cluster ID. Using the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler.

Graphing, the shortest distance, and the density of the data points are a few of the elements that influence cluster formation. Clustering is the process of determining how related the objects are based on a metric called the similarity measure. Similarity metrics are easier to locate in smaller sets of features. It gets harder to create similarity measures as the number of features increases. Depending on the type of clustering algorithm being utilized in data mining, several techniques are employed to group the data from the datasets. In this part, the clustering techniques are described. Various types of clustering algorithms are: Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods) Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods) Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering) Distribution-based Clustering","title":"Types of Clustering Algorithms"},{"location":"AIML/Unsupervised/Clustering/Clustering-overview.html#1-centroid-based-clustering-partitioning-methods","text":"Partitioning methods are the most easiest clustering algorithms. They group data points on the basis of their closeness. Generally, the similarity measure chosen for these algorithms are Euclidian distance, Manhattan Distance or Minkowski Distance. The datasets are separated into a predetermined number of clusters, and each cluster is referenced by a vector of values. When compared to the vector value, the input data variable shows no difference and joins the cluster. The primary drawback for these algorithms is the requirement that we establish the number of clusters, \u201ck,\u201d either intuitively or scientifically (using the Elbow Method) before any clustering machine learning system starts allocating the data points. Despite this, it is still the most popular type of clustering. K-means and K-medoids clustering are some examples of this type clustering.","title":"1.

Contrary to centroid-based clustering, which requires that the number of clusters be predefined and is sensitive to initialization, density-based clustering determines the number of clusters automatically and is less susceptible to beginning positions. They are great at handling clusters of different sizes and forms, making them ideally suited for datasets with irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters. These methods manage both dense and sparse data regions by focusing on local density and can distinguish clusters with a variety of morphologies. In contrast, centroid-based grouping, like k-means, has trouble finding arbitrary shaped clusters. Due to its preset number of cluster requirements and extreme sensitivity to the initial positioning of centroids, the outcomes can vary. Furthermore, the tendency of centroid-based approaches to produce spherical or convex clusters restricts their capacity to handle complicated or irregularly shaped clusters. In conclusion, density-based clustering overcomes the drawbacks of centroid-based techniques by autonomously choosing cluster sizes, being resilient to initialization, and successfully capturing clusters of various sizes and forms. The most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN.","title":"2. Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)"},{"location":"AIML/Unsupervised/Clustering/Clustering-overview.html#3-connectivity-based-clustering-hierarchical-clustering","text":"A method for assembling related data points into hierarchical clusters is called hierarchical clustering. Each data point is initially taken into account as a separate cluster, which is subsequently combined with the clusters that are the most similar to form one large cluster that contains all of the data points. Think about how you may arrange a collection of items based on how similar they are. Each object begins as its own cluster at the base of the tree when using hierarchical clustering, which creates a dendrogram, a tree-like structure. The closest pairings of clusters are then combined into larger clusters after the algorithm examines how similar the objects are to one another. When every object is in one cluster at the top of the tree, the merging process has finished. Exploring various granularity levels is one of the fun things about hierarchical clustering. To obtain a given number of clusters, you can select to cut the dendrogram at a particular height. The more similar two objects are within a cluster, the closer they are. It\u2019s comparable to classifying items according to their family trees, where the nearest relatives are clustered together and the wider branches signify more general connections. There are 2 approaches for Hierarchical clustering: Divisive Clustering: It follows a top-down approach, here we consider all data points to be part one big cluster and then this cluster is divide into smaller groups. Agglomerative Clustering: It follows a bottom-up approach, here we consider all data points to be part of individual clusters and then these clusters are clubbed together to make one big cluster with all data points.","title":"3.

The data elements are grouped using a probability-based distribution that is based on statistical distributions. Included are data objects that have a higher likelihood of being in the cluster. A data point is less likely to be included in a cluster the further it is from the cluster\u2019s central point, which exists in every cluster. A notable drawback of density and boundary-based approaches is the need to specify the clusters a priori for some algorithms, and primarily the definition of the cluster form for the bulk of algorithms. There must be at least one tuning or hyper-parameter selected, and while doing so should be simple, getting it wrong could have unanticipated repercussions. Distribution-based clustering has a definite advantage over proximity and centroid-based clustering approaches in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and cluster structure. The key issue is that, in order to avoid overfitting, many clustering methods only work with simulated or manufactured data, or when the bulk of the data points certainly belong to a preset distribution.

What is K-means Clustering? # Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machine\u2019s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster. In the analysis we assume that number of cluster is given in advanced and we have to put points in one of the group. In some cases, K is not clearly defined, and we have to think about the optimal number of K. K Means clustering performs best data is well separated. When data points overlapped this clustering is not suitable. K Means is faster as compare to other clustering technique. It provides strong coupling between the data points. K Means cluster do not provide clear information regarding the quality of clusters. Different initial assignment of cluster centroid may lead to different clusters. Also, K Means algorithm is sensitive to noise. It may have stuck in local minima. What is the objective of k-means clustering? # The goal of clustering is to divide the population or set of data points into a number of groups so that the data points within each group are more comparable to one another and different from the data points within the other groups. It is essentially a grouping of things based on how similar and different they are to one another. How k-means clustering works? # We are given a data set of items, with certain features, and values for these features (like a vector). The task is to categorize those items into groups. To achieve this, we will use the K-means algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm. \u2018K\u2019 in the name of the algorithm represents the number of groups/clusters we want to classify our items into. (It will help if you think of items as points in an n-dimensional space). The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups or clusters of similarity. To calculate that similarity, we will use the Euclidean distance as a measurement. The algorithm works as follows: First, we randomly initialize k points, called means or cluster centroids. We categorize each item to its closest mean, and we update the mean\u2019s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that cluster so far. We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters. The \u201cpoints\u201d mentioned above are called means because they are the mean values of the items categorized in them. To initialize these means, we have a lot of options. An intuitive method is to initialize the means at random items in the data set. Another method is to initialize the means at random values between the boundaries of the data set (if for a feature x, the items have values in [0,3], we will initialize the means with values for x at [0,3]). The above algorithm in pseudocode is as follows: Initialize k means with random values --> For a given number of iterations : --> Iterate through items : --> Find the mean closest to the item by calculating the euclidean distance of the item with each of the means --> Assign item to mean --> Update mean by shifting it to the average of the items in that cluster Implementation of K-Means Clustering in Python # Example 1: Import the necessary Libraries We are importing Numpy for statistical computations, Matplotlib to plot the graph, and make_blobs from sklearn.datasets. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs Create the custom dataset with make_blobs and plot it X,y = make_blobs(n_samples = 500,n_features = 2,centers = 3,random_state = 23) fig = plt.figure(0) plt.grid(True) plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1]) plt.show() Initialize the random centroids The code initializes three clusters for K-means clustering.

It is available as both open-source software and a cloud service. Milvus is an open-source project under LF AI & Data Foundation distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Core contributors include professionals from Zilliz, ARM, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Meta, IBM, Salesforce, Alibaba, and Microsoft. Unstructured Data, Embeddings, and Milvus # Unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, varies in format and carries rich underlying semantics, making it challenging to analyze. To manage this complexity, embeddings are used to convert unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture its essential characteristics. These vectors are then stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable searches and analytics. Milvus offers robust data modeling capabilities, enabling you to organize your unstructured or multi-modal data into structured collections. It supports a wide range of data types for different attribute modeling, including common numerical and character types, various vector types, arrays, sets, and JSON, saving you from the effort of maintaining multiple database systems. Milvus offers three deployment modes, covering a wide range of data scales\u2014from local prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks to massive Kubernetes clusters managing tens of billions of vectors: Milvus Lite # Milvus Lite is a Python library that can be easily integrated into your applications. As a lightweight version of Milvus, it\u2019s ideal for quick prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running on edge devices with limited resources. Milvus Standalone # Milvus Standalone is a single-machine server deployment, with all components bundled into a single Docker image for convenient deployment. Milvus Distributed # Milvus Distributed can be deployed on Kubernetes clusters, featuring a cloud-native architecture designed for billion-scale or even larger scenarios. Milvus Lite is recommended for smaller datasets, up to a few million vectors. Milvus Standalone is suitable for medium-sized datasets, scaling up to 100 million vectors. Milvus Distributed is designed for large-scale deployments, capable of handling datasets from 100 million up to tens of billions of vectors. Indexes supported in Milvus # Milvus supports various index types, which are categorized by the type of vector embeddings they handle: floating-point embeddings (also known as floating point vectors or dense vectors), binary embeddings (also known as binary vectors), and sparse embeddings (also known as sparse vectors). Floating-point embeddings # Indexes for floating-point embeddings # For 128-dimensional floating-point embeddings (vectors), the storage they take up is 128 * the size of float = 512 bytes. And the distance metrics used for float-point embeddings are Euclidean distance (L2) and Inner product (IP) . These types of indexes include for CPU-based ANN searches.: FLAT IVF_FLAT IVF_PQ IVF_SQ8 HNSW HNSW_SQ HNSW_PQ HNSW_PRQ SCANN Indexes for binary embeddings # For 128-dimensional binary embeddings, the storage they take up is 128 / 8 = 16 bytes. And the distance metrics used for binary embeddings are JACCARD and HAMMING . This type of indexes include BIN_FLAT and BIN_IVF_FLAT . Indexes for sparse embeddings # Indexes for sparse embeddings support the IP and BM25 (for full-text search) metrics only. Index type supported for sparse embeddings: SPARSE_INVERTED_INDEX . GPU Index # Milvus supports various GPU index types to accelerate search performance and efficiency, especially in high-throughput, and high-recall scenarios. GPU_CAGRA GPU_IVF_FLAT GPU_IVF_PQ GPU_BRUTE_FORCE Scalar Index # Milvus supports filtered searches combining both scalar and vector fields. To enhance the efficiency of searches involving scalar fields, Milvus introduced scalar field indexing starting from version 2.1.0. Scalar field indexing algorithms # Milvus aims to achieve low memory usage, high filtering efficiency, and short loading time with its scalar field indexing algorithms. These algorithms are categorized into two main types: auto indexing and inverted indexing . Auto indexing # Milvus provides the AUTOINDEX option to free you from having to manually choose an index type. When calling the create_index method, if the index_type is not specified, Milvus automatically selects the most suitable index type based on the data type. The following table lists the data types that Milvus supports and their corresponding auto indexing algorithms. Inverted indexing # Inverted indexing offers a flexible way to create an index for a scalar field by manually specifying index parameters. This method works well for various scenarios, including point queries, pattern match queries, full-text searches, JSON searches, Boolean searches, and even prefix match queries. An inverted index has two main components: a term dictionary and an inverted list. The term dictionary includes all tokenized words sorted alphabetically, while the inverted list contains the list of documents where each word appears. This setup makes point queries and range queries much faster and more efficient than brute-force searches. Metric Types # Similarity metrics are used to measure similarities among vectors. Choosing an appropriate distance metric helps improve classification and clustering performance significantly. Currently, Milvus supports these types of similarity Metrics: Euclidean distance (L2) , Inner Product (IP) , Cosine Similarity (COSINE), JACCARD, HAMMING, and BM25 (specifically designed for full text search on sparse vectors). Euclidean distance (L2) # Essentially, Euclidean distance measures the length of a segment that connects 2 points. NOTE: Milvus only calculates the value before applying the square root when Euclidean distance is chosen as the distance metric. Inner product (IP) # IP is more useful if you need to compare non-normalized data or when you care about magnitude and angle. NOTE: If you use IP to calculate similarities between embeddings, you must normalize your embeddings. After normalization, the inner product equals cosine similarity. Cosine similarity # Cosine similarity uses the cosine of the angle between two sets of vectors to measure how similar they are. You can think of the two sets of vectors as line segments starting from the same point, such as [0,0,\u2026], but pointing in different directions. The cosine similarity is always in the interval [-1, 1]. For example, two proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1, two orthogonal vectors have a similarity of 0, and two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1. The larger the cosine, the smaller the angle between the two vectors, indicating that these two vectors are more similar to each other. JACCARD distance # JACCARD similarity coefficient measures the similarity between two sample sets and is defined as the cardinality of the intersection of the defined sets divided by the cardinality of the union of them. It can only be applied to finite sample sets. HAMMING distance # HAMMING distance measures binary data strings. The distance between two strings of equal length is the number of bit positions at which the bits are different. For example, suppose there are two strings, 1101 1001 and 1001 1101. 11011001 \u2295 10011101 = 01000100. Since, this contains two 1s, the HAMMING distance, d (11011001, 10011101) = 2. BM25 similarity # BM25 is a widely used text relevance measurement method, specifically designed for full text search. It combines the following three key factors: Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a term appears in a document. While higher frequencies often indicate greater importance, BM25 uses the saturation parameter k1 to prevent overly frequent terms from dominating the relevance score. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Reflects the importance of a term across the entire corpus. Terms appearing in fewer documents receive a higher IDF value, indicating greater contribution to relevance. Document Length Normalization: Longer documents tend to score higher due to containing more terms. BM25 mitigates this bias by normalizing document lengths, with parameter b controlling the strength of this normalization. Consistency Level # As a distributed vector database, Milvus offers multiple levels of consistency to ensure that each node or replica can access the same data during read and write operations. Currently, the supported levels of consistency include Strong, Bounded, Eventually, and Session, with Bounded being the default level of consistency used. Milvus provides four types of consistency levels with different GuaranteeTs. # Strong: The latest timestamp is used as the GuaranteeTs, and QueryNodes have to wait until the ServiceTime meets the GuaranteeTs before executing Search requests. Eventual: The GuaranteeTs is set to an extremely small value, such as 1, to avoid consistency checks so that QueryNodes can immediately execute Search requests upon all batch data. Bounded Staleness: The GuranteeTs is set to a time point earlier than the latest timestamp to make QueryNodes to perform searches with a tolerance of certain data loss. Session: The latest time point at which the client inserts data is used as the GuaranteeTs so that QueryNodes can perform searches upon all the data inserted by the client. Milvus uses Bounded Staleness as the default consistency level. If the GuaranteeTs is left unspecified, the latest ServiceTime is used as the GuaranteeTs. Set Consistency Level # In-Memory Replica # In-memory replica (replication) mechanism in Milvus that enables multiple segment replications in the working memory to improve performance and availability. With in-memory replicas, Milvus can load the same segment on multiple query nodes. If one query node has failed or is busy with a current search request when another arrives, the system can send new requests to an idle query node that has a replication of the same segment. Performance In-memory replicas allow you to leverage extra CPU and memory resources. It is very useful if you have a relatively small dataset but want to increase read throughput with extra hardware resources. Overall QPS (query per second) and throughput can be significantly improved. Availability In-memory replicas help Milvus recover faster if a query node crashes. When a query node fails, the segment does not have to be reloaded on another query node. Instead, the search request can be resent to a new query node immediately without having to reload the data again. With multiple segment replicas maintained simultaneously, the system is more resilient in the face of a failover. Key Concepts In-memory replicas are organized as replica groups. Each replica group contains shard replicas. Each shard replica has a streaming replica and a historical replica that correspond to the growing and sealed segments in the shard (i.e. DML channel). Terminology # AutoID: AutoID is an attribute of the primary field that determines whether to enable AutoIncrement for the primary field. The value of AutoID is defined based on a timestamp. Auto Index: Milvus automatically decides the most appropriate index type and params for a specific field based on empirical data. This is ideal for situations when you do not need to control the specific index params. Attu: Attu is an all-in-one administration tool for Milvus that significantly reduces the complexity and cost of managing the system. Birdwatcher: Birdwatcher is a debugging tool for Milvus that connects to etcd, allowing you to monitor the status of the Milvus server and make adjustments in real-time. It also supports etcd file backups, aiding developers in troubleshooting. Bulk Writer: Bulk Writer is a data processing tool provided by Milvus SDKs (e.g. PyMilvus, Java SDK) , designed to convert raw datasets into a format compatible with Milvus for efficient importing. Bulk Insert: Bulk Insert is an API that enhances writing performance by allowing multiple files to be imported in a single request, optimizing operations with large datasets. Cardinal: Cardinal, developed by Zilliz Cloud, is a cutter-edge vector search algorithm that delivers unparalleled search quality and performance. With its innovative design and extensive optimizations, Cardinal outperforms Knowhere by several times to an order of magnitude while adaptively handling diverse production scenarios, such as varying K sizes, high filtering, different data distributions, and so on. Channel: Milvus utilizes two types of channels, PChannel and VChannel. Each PChannel corresponds to a topic for log storage, while each VChannel corresponds to a shard in a collection. Collection: In Milvus, a collection is equivalent to a table in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Collections are major logical objects used to store and manage entities. For more information, refer to Manage Collections. Dependency: A dependency is a program that another program relies on to work. Milvus\u2019 dependencies include etcd (stores meta data), MinIO or S3 (object storage), and Pulsar (manages snapshot logs). For more information, refer to Manage Dependencies. Dynamic schema: Dynamic schema allows you to insert entities with new fields into a collection without modifying the existing schema. This means that you can insert data without knowing the full schema of a collection and can include fields that are not yet defined. You can enable this schema-free capability by enableing the dynamic field when creating a collection. Embeddings: Milvus offers built-in embedding functions that work with popular embedding providers. Before creating a collection in Milvus, you can use these functions to generate embeddings for your datasets, streamlining the process of preparing data and vector searches. Entity: An entity consists of a group of fields that represent real-world objects. Each entity in Milvus is represented by a unique primary key. Field: A field in a Milvus collection is equivalent to a column of table in a RDBMS. Fields can be either scalar fields for structured data (e.g., numbers, strings), or vector fields for embedding vectors. Filter: Milvus supports scalar filtering by searching with predicates, allowing you to define filter conditions within queries and searches to refine results. Filtered search: Filtered search applies scalar filters to vector searches, allowing you to refine the search results based on specific criteria. Hybrid search: Hybrid Search is an API for hybrid search since Milvus 2.4.0. You can search multiple vector fields and fusion them. Index: A vector index is a reorganized data structure derived from raw data that can greatly accelerate the process of vector similarity search. Milvus supports a wide range of index types for both vector fields and scalar fields. Kafka-Milvus Connector: Kafka-Milvus Connector refers to a Kafka sink connector for Milvus. It allows you to stream vector data from Kafka to Milvus. Knowhere: Knowhere is the core vector execution engine of Milvus which incorporates several vector similarity search libraries including Faiss, Hnswlib, and Annoy. Knowhere is also designed to support heterogeneous computing. It controls on which hardware (CPU or GPU) to execute index building and search requests. This is how Knowhere gets its name - knowing where to execute the operations. Partitionr: A partition is a division of a collection. Milvus supports dividing collection data into multiple parts on physical storage. This process is called partitioning, and each partition can contain multiple segments. Metric type: Similarity metric types are used to measure similarities between vectors. Currently, Milvus supports Euclidean distance (L2), Inner product (IP), Cosine similarity (COSINE), and binary metric types. You can choose the most appropriate metric type based on your scenario. Embedding # Embedding is a machine learning concept for mapping data into a high-dimensional space, where data of similar semantic are placed close together. Typically being a Deep Neural Network from BERT or other Transformer families, the embedding model can effectively represent the semantics of text, images, and other data types with a series of numbers known as vectors. There are two main categories of embeddings, each producing a different type of vector: Dense embedding: Most embedding models represent information as a floating point vector of hundreds to thousands of dimensions. The output is called \u201cdense\u201d vectors as most dimensions have non-zero values. For instance, the popular open-source embedding model BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 outputs vectors of 768 floating point numbers (768-dimension float vector). Sparse embedding: In contrast, the output vectors of sparse embeddings has most dimensions being zero, namely \u201csparse\u201d vectors. These vectors often have much higher dimensions (tens of thousands or more) which is determined by the size of the token vocabulary. Sparse vectors can be generated by Deep Neural Networks or statistical analysis of text corpora. Due to their interpretability and observed better out-of-domain generalization capabilities, sparse embeddings are increasingly adopted by developers as a complement to dense embeddings. Milvus is a vector database designed for vector data management, storage, and retrieval. By integrating mainstream embedding and reranking models, you can easily transform original text into searchable vectors or rerank the results using powerful models to achieve more accurate results for RAG. This integration simplifies text transformation and eliminates the need for additional embedding or reranking components, thereby streamlining RAG development and validation.

Rerankers differ from traditional embedding models by taking a query and document as input and directly returning a similarity score instead of embeddings. This score indicates the relevance between the input query and document. Rerankers are often employed after the first stage retrieval, typically done via vector Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) techniques. While ANN searches are efficient at fetching a broad set of potentially relevant results, they might not always prioritize results in terms of actual semantic closeness to the query. Here, rerankers is used to optimize the results order using deeper contextual analyses, often leveraging advanced machine learning models like BERT or other Transformer-based models. By doing this, rerankers can dramatically enhance the accuracy and relevance of the final results presented to the user.

You should carefully examine your data and design the schema of the target collection accordingly. Taking the JSON data in the above diagram as an example, there are two entities in the rows list, each row having six fields. The collection schema selectively includes four: id, vector, scalar_1, and scalar_2 . There are two more things to consider when designing the schema: Whether to enable AutoID: The id field serves as the primary field of the collection. To make the primary field automatically increment, you can enable AutoID in the schema. In this case, you should exclude the id field from each row in the source data. Whether to enable dynamic fields: The target collection can also store fields not included in its pre-defined schema if the schema enables dynamic fields. The $meta field is a reserved JSON field to hold dynamic fields and their values in key-value pairs. In the above diagram, the fields dynamic_field_1 and dynamic_field_2 and the values will be saved as key-value pairs in the $meta field. The following code shows how to set up the schema for the collection illustrated in the above diagram. from pymilvus import MilvusClient , DataType schema = MilvusClient . create_schema ( auto_id = False , enable_dynamic_field = True ) DIM = 512 schema . add_field ( field_name = \"id\" , datatype = DataType .

RemoteBulkWriter differs from LocalBulkWriter in that RemoteBulkWriter transfers the converted data files to a target object storage bucket.

Additionally, you cannot set a partition name in the import request if you have set the Partition Key in the target collection. Constraints # Before importing data, ensure that you have acknowledged the constaints in terms of the following Milvus behaviors: Constraints regarding the Load behavior: If a collection has already been loaded before an import, you can use the refresh_load function to load the newly imported data after the import is complete. Constraints regarding the query & search behaviors: Before the import job status is Completed, the newly import data is guaranteed to be invisible to queries and searches. Once the job status is Completed, - If the collection is not loaded, you can use the load function to load the newly imported data. - If the collection is already loaded, you can call load(is_refresh=True) to load the imported data. Constraints regarding the delete behavior: Before the import job status is Completed, deletion is not guaranteed and may or may not succeed. Deletion after the job status is Completed is guaranted to succeed. Recommendations # We highly recommend utilizing the multi-file import feature, which allows you to upload several files in a single request. This method not only simplifies the import process but also significantly boosts import performance. Meanwhile, by consolidating your uploads, you can reduce the time spent on data management and make your workflow more efficient.

Performance In-memory replicas allow you to leverage extra CPU and memory resources. It is very useful if you have a relatively small dataset but want to increase read throughput with extra hardware resources. Overall QPS (query per second) and throughput can be significantly improved. Availability In-memory replicas help Milvus recover faster if a query node crashes. When a query node fails, the segment does not have to be reloaded on another query node. Instead, the search request can be resent to a new query node immediately without having to reload the data again. With multiple segment replicas maintained simultaneously, the system is more resilient in the face of a failover. Key Concepts In-memory replicas are organized as replica groups. Each replica group contains shard replicas. Each shard replica has a streaming replica and a historical replica that correspond to the growing and sealed segments in the shard (i.e. DML channel).","title":"In-Memory Replica"},{"location":"AIML/VectorDb/milvus.html#terminology","text":"AutoID: AutoID is an attribute of the primary field that determines whether to enable AutoIncrement for the primary field. The value of AutoID is defined based on a timestamp. Auto Index: Milvus automatically decides the most appropriate index type and params for a specific field based on empirical data. This is ideal for situations when you do not need to control the specific index params. Attu: Attu is an all-in-one administration tool for Milvus that significantly reduces the complexity and cost of managing the system. Birdwatcher: Birdwatcher is a debugging tool for Milvus that connects to etcd, allowing you to monitor the status of the Milvus server and make adjustments in real-time. It also supports etcd file backups, aiding developers in troubleshooting. Bulk Writer: Bulk Writer is a data processing tool provided by Milvus SDKs (e.g. PyMilvus, Java SDK) , designed to convert raw datasets into a format compatible with Milvus for efficient importing. Bulk Insert: Bulk Insert is an API that enhances writing performance by allowing multiple files to be imported in a single request, optimizing operations with large datasets. Cardinal: Cardinal, developed by Zilliz Cloud, is a cutter-edge vector search algorithm that delivers unparalleled search quality and performance. With its innovative design and extensive optimizations, Cardinal outperforms Knowhere by several times to an order of magnitude while adaptively handling diverse production scenarios, such as varying K sizes, high filtering, different data distributions, and so on. Channel: Milvus utilizes two types of channels, PChannel and VChannel. Each PChannel corresponds to a topic for log storage, while each VChannel corresponds to a shard in a collection. Collection: In Milvus, a collection is equivalent to a table in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Collections are major logical objects used to store and manage entities. For more information, refer to Manage Collections. Dependency: A dependency is a program that another program relies on to work. Milvus\u2019 dependencies include etcd (stores meta data), MinIO or S3 (object storage), and Pulsar (manages snapshot logs). For more information, refer to Manage Dependencies. Dynamic schema: Dynamic schema allows you to insert entities with new fields into a collection without modifying the existing schema. This means that you can insert data without knowing the full schema of a collection and can include fields that are not yet defined. You can enable this schema-free capability by enableing the dynamic field when creating a collection. Embeddings: Milvus offers built-in embedding functions that work with popular embedding providers. Before creating a collection in Milvus, you can use these functions to generate embeddings for your datasets, streamlining the process of preparing data and vector searches. Entity: An entity consists of a group of fields that represent real-world objects. Each entity in Milvus is represented by a unique primary key. Field: A field in a Milvus collection is equivalent to a column of table in a RDBMS. Fields can be either scalar fields for structured data (e.g., numbers, strings), or vector fields for embedding vectors. Filter: Milvus supports scalar filtering by searching with predicates, allowing you to define filter conditions within queries and searches to refine results. Filtered search: Filtered search applies scalar filters to vector searches, allowing you to refine the search results based on specific criteria. Hybrid search: Hybrid Search is an API for hybrid search since Milvus 2.4.0. You can search multiple vector fields and fusion them. Index: A vector index is a reorganized data structure derived from raw data that can greatly accelerate the process of vector similarity search. Milvus supports a wide range of index types for both vector fields and scalar fields. Kafka-Milvus Connector: Kafka-Milvus Connector refers to a Kafka sink connector for Milvus. It allows you to stream vector data from Kafka to Milvus. Knowhere: Knowhere is the core vector execution engine of Milvus which incorporates several vector similarity search libraries including Faiss, Hnswlib, and Annoy. Knowhere is also designed to support heterogeneous computing. It controls on which hardware (CPU or GPU) to execute index building and search requests. This is how Knowhere gets its name - knowing where to execute the operations. Partitionr: A partition is a division of a collection. Milvus supports dividing collection data into multiple parts on physical storage. This process is called partitioning, and each partition can contain multiple segments. Metric type: Similarity metric types are used to measure similarities between vectors. Currently, Milvus supports Euclidean distance (L2), Inner product (IP), Cosine similarity (COSINE), and binary metric types.

There are two main categories of embeddings, each producing a different type of vector: Dense embedding: Most embedding models represent information as a floating point vector of hundreds to thousands of dimensions. The output is called \u201cdense\u201d vectors as most dimensions have non-zero values. For instance, the popular open-source embedding model BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 outputs vectors of 768 floating point numbers (768-dimension float vector). Sparse embedding: In contrast, the output vectors of sparse embeddings has most dimensions being zero, namely \u201csparse\u201d vectors. These vectors often have much higher dimensions (tens of thousands or more) which is determined by the size of the token vocabulary. Sparse vectors can be generated by Deep Neural Networks or statistical analysis of text corpora. Due to their interpretability and observed better out-of-domain generalization capabilities, sparse embeddings are increasingly adopted by developers as a complement to dense embeddings. Milvus is a vector database designed for vector data management, storage, and retrieval. By integrating mainstream embedding and reranking models, you can easily transform original text into searchable vectors or rerank the results using powerful models to achieve more accurate results for RAG. This integration simplifies text transformation and eliminates the need for additional embedding or reranking components, thereby streamlining RAG development and validation. To create embeddings in action, refer to Using PyMilvus\u2019s Model To Generate Text Embeddings.","title":"Embedding"},{"location":"AIML/VectorDb/milvus.html#openaiembeddingfunction","text":"OpenAIEmbeddingFunction is a class in pymilvus that handles encoding text into embeddings using OpenAI models to support embedding retrieval in Milvus. pymilvus.model.dense.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction Constructor Constructs an OpenAIEmbeddingFunction for common use cases.

Rerankers are often employed after the first stage retrieval, typically done via vector Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) techniques. While ANN searches are efficient at fetching a broad set of potentially relevant results, they might not always prioritize results in terms of actual semantic closeness to the query. Here, rerankers is used to optimize the results order using deeper contextual analyses, often leveraging advanced machine learning models like BERT or other Transformer-based models.

You should carefully examine your data and design the schema of the target collection accordingly. Taking the JSON data in the above diagram as an example, there are two entities in the rows list, each row having six fields. The collection schema selectively includes four: id, vector, scalar_1, and scalar_2 . There are two more things to consider when designing the schema: Whether to enable AutoID: The id field serves as the primary field of the collection. To make the primary field automatically increment, you can enable AutoID in the schema. In this case, you should exclude the id field from each row in the source data. Whether to enable dynamic fields: The target collection can also store fields not included in its pre-defined schema if the schema enables dynamic fields. The $meta field is a reserved JSON field to hold dynamic fields and their values in key-value pairs. In the above diagram, the fields dynamic_field_1 and dynamic_field_2 and the values will be saved as key-value pairs in the $meta field. The following code shows how to set up the schema for the collection illustrated in the above diagram. from pymilvus import MilvusClient , DataType schema = MilvusClient . create_schema ( auto_id = False , enable_dynamic_field = True ) DIM = 512 schema . add_field ( field_name = \"id\" , datatype = DataType .

Vector databases are especially useful for handling data from applications in AI and machine learning, particularly in tasks involving similarity search and recommendation engines. A Vector Database, at its essence, is a relational database system specifically designed to process vectorized data. Unlike conventional databases that contain information in tables, rows, and columns, vector databases work with vectors\u2013arrays of numerical values that signify points in multidimensional space. Vectors, in turn, are everywhere and are commonly used in, for instance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, genomics, and geospatial analysis. At these datasets, there are frequently high-dimensional vectors where each dimension represents a particular attribute or feature. Such data place a heavy burden on traditional databases as they are tabular in form and do not allow efficiency in the storage and retrieval of such data and there comes the bottleneck in the performance of the database. What is a Vector? # Vector in the field of mathematics and data science refers to a serial arrangement of numerical values. It is a node in a many-dimensional space where one weight from each vector corresponds to a specific dimension. In the domain of vector databases, such arrays of numerical values, thus, turn into primitive concepts of information, making it possible for the store and processing of data in high dimensions. How Vector Databases Work? # Vector Database is a type of database that is used in various machine learning use cases. They are specialized for the storage and retrieval of vector data. What are embeddings? Embedding is a data like words that have been converted into an array of numbers known as a vector that contains patterns of relationships the combination of these numbers that make up the vector act as a multi-dimensional map to measure similarity. The combination of these numbers that make up the vector act as a multi-dimensional map to measure similarity. Let\u2019s see an example describe a 2d graph the words dog and puppy are often used in similar situations. So in a word embedding they would be represented by vectors that are close together. Well this is a simple 2D example of a single dimension in reality the vector has hundreds of Dimensions that cover the rich multi-dimensional complex relationship between words. Example Images can also be turned into vectors. Google does similar images searches and the image sections are broken down into arrays of numbers allowing you to find patterns of similarity for those with closely resembling vectors. Once an embedding is created it can be stored in a database and a database full of these is considered as a vector database. Vector database can be used in several ways, searching where results are ranked by relevance to a query string or clustering where text strings are grouped by similarity and recommendations where items with related text strings are recommended also classification where text strings are classified by their most similar label. Key Components of Vector Databases # Embedding Storage: Stores high-dimensional vectors. Indexing and Search: Uses specialized indexing techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) or FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast similarity search across massive vector datasets. Scalability: Optimized for handling millions to billions of vectors. Metadata Support: Allows for filtering and adding metadata alongside vectors for refined search capabilities. Popular Use Cases # Semantic Search: Finds documents, images, or videos similar in meaning to a search query, even if they don\u2019t share keywords. Recommendation Systems: Suggests items similar to user preferences (like items with similar vector embeddings). Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers in datasets, as anomalies often have unique embeddings. Image and Video Recognition: Matches similar images or videos based on visual features encoded in vectors. Examples of Vector Databases # Weaviate: An open-source vector search engine with strong support for text, image, and video embeddings. Pinecone: A managed vector database with a focus on scalable similarity search and recommendations. FAISS: Primarily a library developed by Facebook AI for fast nearest neighbor search but also used in building vector search systems. Milvus: Another open-source vector database that provides highly scalable, low-latency vector searches. Why Vector Databases Are Important # With the rise of LLMs (large language models) and computer vision, the demand for efficiently storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings has grown.

DCGM includes APIs for gathering GPU telemetry. Of particular interest are GPU utilization metrics (for monitoring Tensor Cores, FP64 units, and so on), memory metrics, and interconnect traffic metrics. DCGM exporter # Monitoring stacks usually consist of a collector, a time-series database to store metrics, and a visualization layer. A popular open-source stack is Prometheus , used along with Grafana as the visualization tool to create rich dashboards. Prometheus also includes Alertmanager to create and manage alerts. Prometheus is deployed along with kube-state-metrics and node_exporter to expose cluster-level metrics for Kubernetes API objects and node-level metrics such as CPU utilization. Figure 1 shows a sample architecture of Prometheus. Per-pod GPU metrics in a Kubernetes cluster # dcgm-exporter collects metrics for all available GPUs on a node. However, in Kubernetes, you might not necessarily know which GPUs in a node would be assigned to a pod when it requests GPU resources. Starting in v1.13, kubelet has added a device monitoring feature that lets you find out the assigned devices to the pod\u2014pod name, pod namespace, and device ID\u2014using a pod-resources socket. The http server in dcgm-exporter connects to the kubelet pod-resources server (/var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources) to identify the GPU devices running on a pod and appends the GPU devices pod information to the metrics collected. Here are some examples of setting up dcgm-exporter . If you use the NVIDIA GPU Operator , then dcgm-exporter is one of the components deployed as part of the operator. $ helm repo add prometheus-community \\ https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts $ helm repo update $ helm inspect values prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack > /tmp/kube-prometheus-stack.values # Edit /tmp/kube-prometheus-stack.values in your favorite editor # according to the documentation # This exposes the service via NodePort so that Prometheus/Grafana # are accessible outside the cluster with a browser $ helm install prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \\ --create-namespace --namespace prometheus \\ --generate-name \\ --set prometheus.service.type = NodePort \\ --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues = false Installing dcgm-exporter # Here\u2019s how to get started installing dcgm-exporter to monitor GPU performance and utilization. You use the Helm chart for setting up dcgm-exporter. First, add the Helm repo: $ helm repo add gpu-helm-charts \\ https://nvidia.github.io/gpu-monitoring-tools/helm-charts $ helm repo update Then, install the chart using Helm: $ helm install \\ --generate-name \\ gpu-helm-charts/dcgm-exporter Using the Grafana service exposed at port 32032, access the Grafana homepage. Log in to the dashboard using the credentials available in the Prometheus chart: the adminPassword field in prometheus.values. To now start a Grafana dashboard for GPU metrics, import the reference NVIDIA dashboard from Grafana Dashboards. !grafana_import_url Using the DCGM dashboard # kubectl port-forward -n prometheus service/kube-prometheus-stack-1744977651-grafana 32032:80 http://127.0.0.1:32032 kubectl - n gpu - operator port - forward svc / nvidia - dcgm - exporter 9400 : 9400 Login to Graphana User: admin, credentials available in the Prometheus chart: the adminPassword field in prometheus.values. adminUser: admin adminPassword: prom-xxxxxxx Click Dashboard New...

As an example, RAG performs retrieval of documents relevant to a user question, and passes those documents to an LLM in order to ground the model's response in the provided document context. Instead of hard-coding a fixed control flow, we sometimes want LLM systems that can pick their own control flow to solve more complex problems! This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. There are many ways that an LLM can control application: An LLM can route between two potential paths An LLM can decide which of many tools to call An LLM can decide whether the generated answer is sufficient or more work is needed Router A router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options. This is an agent architecture that exhibits a relatively limited level of control because the LLM usually focuses on making a single decision and produces a specific output from a limited set of pre-defined options. Routers typically employ a few different concepts to achieve this. Structured Output Structured outputs with LLMs work by providing a specific format or schema that the LLM should follow in its response. This is similar to tool calling, but more general. While tool calling typically involves selecting and using predefined functions, structured outputs can be used for any type of formatted response. Common methods to achieve structured outputs include: Prompt engineering: Instructing the LLM to respond in a specific format via the system prompt. Output parsers: Using post-processing to extract structured data from LLM responses. Tool calling: Leveraging built-in tool calling capabilities of some LLMs to generate structured outputs. Tool-calling agent cWhile a router allows an LLM to make a single decision, more complex agent architectures expand the LLM's control in two key ways: Multi-step decision making: The LLM can make a series of decisions, one after another, instead of just one. Tool access:The LLM can choose from and use a variety of tools to accomplish tasks. \ud83d\udccc Install LangGraph: pip install -U langgraph \ud83d\udccc create an agent using prebuilt components: import os from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model os . environ [ \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" ] = \"sk-proj-*****\" llm = init_chat_model ( \"openai:gpt-4.1\" ) def get_weather ( city : str ) -> str : \"\"\"Get weather for a given city.\"\"\" return f \"It's always sunny in { city } !\" agent = create_react_agent ( model = llm , tools = [ get_weather ], prompt = \"You are a helpful assistant\" ) # Run the agent result = agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what is the weather in sf\" }]} ) # Print the output print ( result [ 'messages' ][ - 1 ] . content ) Output: python langgraph_test.py The weather in San Francisco is reported to be always sunny! If you need a more detailed or up-to-date weather report, please let me know. \ud83d\udccc Core benefits LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for any long-running, stateful workflow or agent.

This makes it easy to integrate various LLMs into your agents and workflows. Initialize a model Use init_chat_model to initialize models: \ud83d\udccc OpenAI: pip install - U \"langchain[openai]\" import os from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model os . environ [ \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" ] = \"sk-...\" llm = init_chat_model ( \"openai:gpt-4.1\" ) \ud83d\udccc Anthropic: pip install - U \"langchain[anthropic]\" import os from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model os . environ [ \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" ] = \"sk-...\" llm = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" ) \ud83d\udccc Azure: pip install - U \"langchain[openai]\" import os from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model os . environ [ \"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\" ] = \"...\" os . environ [ \"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\" ] = \"...\" os . environ [ \"OPENAI_API_VERSION\" ] = \"2025-03-01-preview\" llm = init_chat_model ( \"azure_openai:gpt-4.1\" , azure_deployment = os . environ [ \"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\" ], ) \ud83d\udccc Google Gemini: pip install -U \"langchain[google-genai]\" import os from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model os . environ [ \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" ] = \"...\" llm = init_chat_model ( \"google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash\" ) \ud83d\udccc AWS Bedrock: pip install - U \"langchain[aws]\" from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model # Follow the steps here to configure your credentials: # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html llm = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\" , model_provider = \"bedrock_converse\" , ) \ud83d\udccc Instantiate a model directly If a model provider is not available via init_chat_model, you can instantiate the provider's model class directly. The model must implement the BaseChatModel interface and support tool calling: # Anthropic is already supported by `init_chat_model`, # but you can also instantiate it directly. from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic ( model = \"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , temperature = 0 , max_tokens = 2048 ) \ud83d\udccc Dynamic model selection Pass a callable function to create_react_agent to dynamically select the model at runtime. This is useful for scenarios where you want to choose a model based on user input, configuration settings, or other runtime conditions. The selector function must return a chat model. If you're using tools, you must bind the tools to the model within the selector function. from dataclasses import dataclass from typing import Literal from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model from langchain_core.language_models import BaseChatModel from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState from langgraph.runtime import Runtime @tool def weather () -> str : \"\"\"Returns the current weather conditions.\"\"\" return \"It's nice and sunny.\" # Define the runtime context @dataclass class CustomContext : provider : Literal [ \"anthropic\" , \"openai\" ] # Initialize models openai_model = init_chat_model ( \"openai:gpt-4o\" ) anthropic_model = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514\" ) # Selector function for model choice def select_model ( state : AgentState , runtime : Runtime [ CustomContext ]) -> BaseChatModel : if runtime . context . provider == \"anthropic\" : model = anthropic_model elif runtime . context . provider == \"openai\" : model = openai_model else : raise ValueError ( f \"Unsupported provider: { runtime . context . provider } \" ) # With dynamic model selection, you must bind tools explicitly return model . bind_tools ([ weather ]) # Create agent with dynamic model selection agent = create_react_agent ( select_model , tools = [ weather ]) # Invoke with context to select model output = agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"Which model is handling this?\" , } ] }, context = CustomContext ( provider = \"openai\" ), ) print ( output [ \"messages\" ][ - 1 ] . text ()) \ud83d\udccc Advanced model configuration Disable streaming To disable streaming of the individual LLM tokens, set disable_streaming=True when initializing the model: init_chat_model from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model model = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , disable_streaming = True ) ChatModel from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic ( model = \"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , disable_streaming = True ) \ud83d\udccc Add model fallbacks You can add a fallback to a different model or a different LLM provider using model.with_fallbacks([...]) : init_chat_model from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model model_with_fallbacks = ( init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest\" ) . with_fallbacks ([ init_chat_model ( \"openai:gpt-4.1-mini\" ), ]) ) ChatModel from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model model_with_fallbacks = ( init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest\" ) . with_fallbacks ([ init_chat_model ( \"openai:gpt-4.1-mini\" ), ]) ) \ud83d\udccc Use the built-in rate limiter Langchain includes a built-in in-memory rate limiter. This rate limiter is thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads in the same process. from langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter ( requests_per_second = 0.1 , # <-- Super slow! We can only make a request once every 10 seconds!! check_every_n_seconds = 0.1 , # Wake up every 100 ms to check whether allowed to make a request, max_bucket_size = 10 , # Controls the maximum burst size. ) model = ChatAnthropic ( model_name = \"claude-3-opus-20240229\" , rate_limiter = rate_limiter ) \ud83d\udccc Bring your own model If your desired LLM isn't officially supported by LangChain, consider these options: Implement a custom LangChain chat model: Create a model conforming to the LangChain chat model interface. This enables full compatibility with LangGraph's agents and workflows but requires understanding of the LangChain framework. Direct invocation with custom streaming: Use your model directly by adding custom streaming logic with StreamWriter. Tools # Many AI applications interact with users via natural language. However, some use cases require models to interface directly with external systems\u2014such as APIs, databases, or file systems\u2014using structured input. In these scenarios, tool calling enables models to generate requests that conform to a specified input schema. Tools encapsulate a callable function and its input schema. These can be passed to compatible chat models, allowing the model to decide whether to invoke a tool and with what arguments. Tool calling is typically conditional . Based on the user input and available tools, the model may choose to issue a tool call request. This request is returned in an AIMessage object, which includes a tool_calls field that specifies the tool name and input arguments: llm_with_tools . invoke ( \"What is 2 multiplied by 3?\" ) # -> AIMessage(tool_calls=[{'name': 'multiply', 'args': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}, ...}]) AIMessage ( tool_calls = [ ToolCall ( name = \"multiply\" , args = { \"a\" : 2 , \"b\" : 3 }), ... ] ) If the input is unrelated to any tool, the model returns only a natural language message: llm_with_tools . invoke ( \"Hello world!\" ) # -> AIMessage(content=\"Hello!\") Importantly, the model does not execute the tool\u2014it only generates a request. A separate executor (such as a runtime or agent) is responsible for handling the tool call and returning the result. Custom tools # You can define custom tools using the @tool decorator or plain Python functions. For example: from langchain_core.tools import tool @tool def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Multiply two numbers.\"\"\" return a * b Call tools # Tools encapsulate a callable function and its input schema. These can be passed to compatible chat models, allowing the model to decide whether to invoke a tool and determine the appropriate arguments. You can define your own tools or use prebuilt tools Define a tool Define a basic tool with the @tool decorator: Run a tool Tools conform to the Runnable interface , which means you can run a tool using the invoke method: multiply.invoke({\"a\": 6, \"b\": 7}) # returns 42 If the tool is invoked with type=\"tool_call\" , it will return a ToolMessage: tool_call = { \"type\" : \"tool_call\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"args\" : { \"a\" : 42 , \"b\" : 7 } } multiply . invoke ( tool_call ) # returns a ToolMessage object Output: ToolMessage ( content = '294' , name = 'multiply' , tool_call_id = '1' ) Use in an agent # To create a tool-calling agent, you can use the prebuilt create_react_agent : from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent @tool def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Multiply two numbers.\"\"\" return a * b agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet\" , tools = [ multiply ] ) agent . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's 42 x 7?\" }]}) Dynamically select tools # Configure tool availability at runtime based on context: from dataclasses import dataclass from typing import Literal from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState from langgraph.runtime import Runtime @dataclass class CustomContext : tools : list [ Literal [ \"weather\" , \"compass\" ]] @tool def weather () -> str : \"\"\"Returns the current weather conditions.\"\"\" return \"It's nice and sunny.\" @tool def compass () -> str : \"\"\"Returns the direction the user is facing.\"\"\" return \"North\" model = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514\" ) def configure_model ( state : AgentState , runtime : Runtime [ CustomContext ]): \"\"\"Configure the model with tools based on runtime context.\"\"\" selected_tools = [ tool for tool in [ weather , compass ] if tool . name in runtime . context . tools ] return model . bind_tools ( selected_tools ) agent = create_react_agent ( # Dynamically configure the model with tools based on runtime context configure_model , # Initialize with all tools available tools = [ weather , compass ] ) output = agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"Who are you and what tools do you have access to?\" , } ] }, context = CustomContext ( tools = [ \"weather\" ]), # Only enable the weather tool ) print ( output [ \"messages\" ][ - 1 ] . text ()) Use in a workflow # If you are writing a custom workflow, you will need to: register the tools with the chat model call the tool if the model decides to use it Use model.bind_tools() to register the tools with the model. from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model model = init_chat_model ( model = \"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\" ) model_with_tools = model . bind_tools ([ multiply ]) ToolNode To execute tools in custom workflows, use the prebuilt ToolNode or implement your own custom node. ToolNode is a specialized node for executing tools in a workflow. It provides the following features: Supports both synchronous and asynchronous tools. Executes multiple tools concurrently. Handles errors during tool execution (handle_tool_errors=True, enabled by default). ToolNode operates on MessagesState : Input: MessagesState, where the last message is an AIMessage containing the tool_calls parameter. Output: MessagesState updated with the resulting ToolMessage from executed tools. from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode def get_weather ( location : str ): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location . lower () in [ \"sf\" , \"san francisco\" ]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else : return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" def get_coolest_cities (): \"\"\"Get a list of coolest cities\"\"\" return \"nyc, sf\" tool_node = ToolNode ([ get_weather , get_coolest_cities ]) tool_node . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [ ... ]}) Single tool call from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode # Define tools @tool def get_weather ( location : str ): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location . lower () in [ \"sf\" , \"san francisco\" ]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else : return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" tool_node = ToolNode ([ get_weather ]) message_with_single_tool_call = AIMessage ( content = \"\" , tool_calls = [ { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"args\" : { \"location\" : \"sf\" }, \"id\" : \"tool_call_id\" , \"type\" : \"tool_call\" , } ], ) tool_node . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [ message_with_single_tool_call ]}) Multiple tool calls from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode # Define tools def get_weather ( location : str ): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location . lower () in [ \"sf\" , \"san francisco\" ]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else : return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" def get_coolest_cities (): \"\"\"Get a list of coolest cities\"\"\" return \"nyc, sf\" tool_node = ToolNode ([ get_weather , get_coolest_cities ]) message_with_multiple_tool_calls = AIMessage ( content = \"\" , tool_calls = [ { \"name\" : \"get_coolest_cities\" , \"args\" : {}, \"id\" : \"tool_call_id_1\" , \"type\" : \"tool_call\" , }, { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"args\" : { \"location\" : \"sf\" }, \"id\" : \"tool_call_id_2\" , \"type\" : \"tool_call\" , }, ], ) tool_node . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [ message_with_multiple_tool_calls ]}) Use with a chat model from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode def get_weather ( location : str ): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location . lower () in [ \"sf\" , \"san francisco\" ]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else : return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" tool_node = ToolNode ([ get_weather ]) model = init_chat_model ( model = \"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\" ) model_with_tools = model . bind_tools ([ get_weather ]) response_message = model_with_tools . invoke ( \"what's the weather in sf?\" ) tool_node . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [ response_message ]}) Use in a tool-calling agent from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END def get_weather ( location : str ): \"\"\"Call to get the current weather.\"\"\" if location . lower () in [ \"sf\" , \"san francisco\" ]: return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\" else : return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\" tool_node = ToolNode ([ get_weather ]) model = init_chat_model ( model = \"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\" ) model_with_tools = model . bind_tools ([ get_weather ]) def should_continue ( state : MessagesState ): messages = state [ \"messages\" ] last_message = messages [ - 1 ] if last_message . tool_calls : return \"tools\" return END def call_model ( state : MessagesState ): messages = state [ \"messages\" ] response = model_with_tools . invoke ( messages ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) # Define the two nodes we will cycle between builder . add_node ( \"call_model\" , call_model ) builder . add_node ( \"tools\" , tool_node ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"call_model\" ) builder . add_conditional_edges ( \"call_model\" , should_continue , [ \"tools\" , END ]) builder . add_edge ( \"tools\" , \"call_model\" ) graph = builder . compile () graph . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's the weather in sf?\" }]}) Tool customization # For more control over tool behavior, use the @tool decorator. Parameter descriptions Auto-generate descriptions from docstrings: from langchain_core.tools import tool @tool ( \"multiply_tool\" , parse_docstring = True ) def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Multiply two numbers.

LangGraph provides three methods for managing such context: Configuration Use configuration when you have immutable runtime data that tools require, such as user identifiers. You pass these arguments via RunnableConfig at invocation and access them in the tool: from langchain_core.tools import tool from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig @tool def get_user_info ( config : RunnableConfig ) -> str : \"\"\"Retrieve user information based on user ID.\"\"\" user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) return \"User is John Smith\" if user_id == \"user_123\" else \"Unknown user\" # Invocation example with an agent agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"look up user info\" }]}, config = { \"configurable\" : { \"user_id\" : \"user_123\" }} ) Extended example: Access config in tools from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent def get_user_info ( config : RunnableConfig , ) -> str : \"\"\"Look up user info.\"\"\" user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) return \"User is John Smith\" if user_id == \"user_123\" else \"Unknown user\" agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ get_user_info ], ) agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"look up user information\" }]}, config = { \"configurable\" : { \"user_id\" : \"user_123\" }} ) Short-term memory Short-term memory maintains dynamic state that changes during a single execution. To access (read) the graph state inside the tools, you can use a special parameter annotation \u2014 InjectedState: from typing import Annotated , NotRequired from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState , create_react_agent from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState class CustomState ( AgentState ): # The user_name field in short-term state user_name : NotRequired [ str ] @tool def get_user_name ( state : Annotated [ CustomState , InjectedState ] ) -> str : \"\"\"Retrieve the current user-name from state.\"\"\" # Return stored name or a default if not set return state . get ( \"user_name\" , \"Unknown user\" ) # Example agent setup agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ get_user_name ], state_schema = CustomState , ) # Invocation: reads the name from state (initially empty) agent . invoke ({ \"messages\" : \"what's my name?\" }) Long-term memory Use long-term memory to store user-specific or application-specific data across conversations. This is useful for applications like chatbots, where you want to remember user preferences or other information. To use long-term memory, you need to: Configure a store to persist data across invocations. Access the store from within tools. To access information in the store: from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from langgraph.config import get_store @tool def get_user_info ( config : RunnableConfig ) -> str : \"\"\"Look up user info.\"\"\" # Same as that provided to `builder.compile(store=store)` # or `create_react_agent` store = get_store () user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) user_info = store . get (( \"users\" ,), user_id ) return str ( user_info . value ) if user_info else \"Unknown user\" builder = StateGraph ( ... ) ... graph = builder . compile ( store = store ) Access long-term memory from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.config import get_store from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore store = InMemoryStore () store . put ( ( \"users\" ,), \"user_123\" , { \"name\" : \"John Smith\" , \"language\" : \"English\" , } ) @tool def get_user_info ( config : RunnableConfig ) -> str : \"\"\"Look up user info.\"\"\" # Same as that provided to `create_react_agent` store = get_store () user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) user_info = store . get (( \"users\" ,), user_id ) return str ( user_info . value ) if user_info else \"Unknown user\" agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ get_user_info ], store = store ) # Run the agent agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"look up user information\" }]}, config = { \"configurable\" : { \"user_id\" : \"user_123\" }} ) To update information in the store: from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from langgraph.config import get_store @tool def save_user_info ( user_info : str , config : RunnableConfig ) -> str : \"\"\"Save user info.\"\"\" # Same as that provided to `builder.compile(store=store)` # or `create_react_agent` store = get_store () user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) store . put (( \"users\" ,), user_id , user_info ) return \"Successfully saved user info.\" builder = StateGraph ( ... ) ... graph = builder . compile ( store = store ) Update long-term memory from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.config import get_store from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore store = InMemoryStore () class UserInfo ( TypedDict ): name : str @tool def save_user_info ( user_info : UserInfo , config : RunnableConfig ) -> str : \"\"\"Save user info.\"\"\" # Same as that provided to `create_react_agent` store = get_store () user_id = config [ \"configurable\" ] . get ( \"user_id\" ) store . put (( \"users\" ,), user_id , user_info ) return \"Successfully saved user info.\" agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ save_user_info ], store = store ) # Run the agent agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"My name is John Smith\" }]}, config = { \"configurable\" : { \"user_id\" : \"user_123\" }} ) # You can access the store directly to get the value store . get (( \"users\" ,), \"user_123\" ) . value Advanced tool features # Immediate return Use return_direct=True to immediately return a tool's result without executing additional logic. This is useful for tools that should not trigger further processing or tool calls, allowing you to return results directly to the user. @ tool ( return_direct = True ) def add ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\" return a + b Extended example: Using return_direct in a prebuilt agent from langchain_core.tools import tool from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent @tool ( return_direct = True ) def add ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\" return a + b agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ add ] ) agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's 3 + 5?\" }]} ) Force tool use If you need to force a specific tool to be used, you will need to configure this at the model level using the tool_choice parameter in the bind_tools method. Force specific tool usage via tool_choice: @tool ( return_direct = True ) def greet ( user_name : str ) -> int : \"\"\"Greet user.\"\"\" return f \"Hello {user_name}!\" tools = [ greet ] configured_model = model . bind_tools ( tools , # Force the use of the 'greet' tool tool_choice = { \"type\" : \"tool\" , \"name\" : \"greet\" } ) Extended example: Force tool usage in an agent from langchain_core.tools import tool @tool ( return_direct = True ) def greet ( user_name : str ) -> int : \"\"\"Greet user.\"\"\" return f \"Hello { user_name } !\" tools = [ greet ] agent = create_react_agent ( model = model . bind_tools ( tools , tool_choice = { \"type\" : \"tool\" , \"name\" : \"greet\" }), tools = tools ) agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"Hi, I am Bob\" }]} ) Forcing tool usage without stopping conditions can create infinite loops. Use one of the following safeguards: Mark the tool with return_direct=True to end the loop after execution. Set recursion_limit to restrict the number of execution steps. Disable parallel calls For supported providers, you can disable parallel tool calling by setting parallel_tool_calls=False via the model.bind_tools() method: Extended example: disable parallel tool calls in a prebuilt agent from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model def add ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\" return a + b def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Multiply two numbers.\"\"\" return a * b model = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , temperature = 0 ) tools = [ add , multiply ] agent = create_react_agent ( # disable parallel tool calls model = model . bind_tools ( tools , parallel_tool_calls = False ), tools = tools ) agent . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's 3 + 5 and 4 * 7?\" }]} ) Handle errors LangGraph provides built-in error handling for tool execution through the prebuilt ToolNode component, used both independently and in prebuilt agents. By default, ToolNode catches exceptions raised during tool execution and returns them as ToolMessage objects with a status indicating an error. from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : if a == 42 : raise ValueError ( \"The ultimate error\" ) return a * b # Default error handling (enabled by default) tool_node = ToolNode ([ multiply ]) message = AIMessage ( content = \"\" , tool_calls = [{ \"name\" : \"multiply\" , \"args\" : { \"a\" : 42 , \"b\" : 7 }, \"id\" : \"tool_call_id\" , \"type\" : \"tool_call\" }] ) result = tool_node . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [ message ]}) Output: { 'messages' : [ ToolMessage ( content = \"Error: ValueError('The ultimate error') \\n Please fix your mistakes.\" , name = 'multiply' , tool_call_id = 'tool_call_id' , status = 'error' ) ]} Disable error handling To propagate exceptions directly, disable error handling: tool_node = ToolNode ( [ multiply ] , handle_tool_errors = False ) Example output: { 'messages' : [ ToolMessage ( content = \"Can't use 42 as the first operand, please switch operands!\" , name = 'multiply' , tool_call_id = 'tool_call_id' , status = 'error' ) ]} Error handling in agents Error handling in prebuilt agents ( create_react_agent ) leverages ToolNode : from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ multiply ] ) # Default error handling agent . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's 42 x 7?\" }]}) To disable or customize error handling in prebuilt agents, explicitly pass a configured ToolNode: custom_tool_node = ToolNode ( [ multiply ] , handle_tool_errors = \"Cannot use 42 as a first operand!\" ) agent_custom = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools = custom_tool_node ) agent_custom . invoke ( { \"messages\" : [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"what's 42 x 7?\"} ] } ) Handle large numbers of tools As the number of available tools grows, you may want to limit the scope of the LLM's selection, to decrease token consumption and to help manage sources of error in LLM reasoning. To address this, you can dynamically adjust the tools available to a model by retrieving relevant tools at runtime using semantic search. Human-in-the-loop # To review, edit, and approve tool calls in an agent or workflow, use LangGraph's human-in-the-loop features to enable human intervention at any point in a workflow. This is especially useful in large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction, or additional context. Key capabilities Persistent execution state: Interrupts use LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the graph state, to indefinitely pause graph execution until you resume. This is possible because LangGraph checkpoints the graph state after each step, which allows the system to persist execution context and later resume the workflow, continuing from where it left off. This supports asynchronous human review or input without time constraints. There are two ways to pause a graph: Dynamic interrupts: Use interrupt to pause a graph from inside a specific node, based on the current state of the graph. Static interrupts: Use interrupt_before and interrupt_after to pause the graph at pre-defined points, either before or after a node executes. Flexible integration points: Human-in-the-loop logic can be introduced at any point in the workflow. This allows targeted human involvement, such as approving API calls, correcting outputs, or guiding conversations. Patterns There are four typical design patterns that you can implement using interrupt and Command : Approve or reject: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involves routing the graph based on the human's input. Edit graph state: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves updating the state with the human's input. Review tool calls: Pause the graph to review and edit tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution. Validate human input: Pause the graph to validate human input before proceeding with the next step. Enable human intervention # To review, edit, and approve tool calls in an agent or workflow, use interrupts to pause a graph and wait for human input. Interrupts use LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the graph state, to indefinitely pause graph execution until you resume. Pause using interrupt Dynamic interrupts (also known as dynamic breakpoints) are triggered based on the current state of the graph. You can set dynamic interrupts by calling interrupt function in the appropriate place. The graph will pause, which allows for human intervention, and then resumes the graph with their input. It's useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or gathering additional context. To use interrupt in your graph, you need to: Specify a checkpointer to save the graph state after each step. Call interrupt() in the appropriate place. See the Common Patterns section for examples. Run the graph with a thread ID until the interrupt is hit. Resume execution using invoke/stream from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command def human_node ( state : State ): value = interrupt ( { \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"some_text\" ] } ) return { \"some_text\" : value } graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) # Run the graph until the interrupt is hit. config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"some_id\" }} result = graph . invoke ({ \"some_text\" : \"original text\" }, config = config ) print ( result [ '__interrupt__' ]) # > [ # > Interrupt( # > value={'text_to_revise': 'original text'}, # > resumable=True, # > ns=['human_node:6ce9e64f-edef-fe5d-f7dc-511fa9526960'] # > ) # > ] print ( graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = \"Edited text\" ), config = config )) # > {'some_text': 'Edited text'} When the interrupt function is used within a graph, execution pauses at that point and awaits user input. To resume execution, use the Command primitive, which can be supplied via the invoke or stream methods. The graph resumes execution from the beginning of the node where interrupt(...) was initially called. This time, the interrupt function will return the value provided in Command(resume=value) rather than pausing again. All code from the beginning of the node to the interrupt will be re-executed. # Resume graph execution by providing the user's input. graph.invoke(Command(resume={\"age\": \"25\"}), thread_config) Resume multiple interrupts with one invocation When nodes with interrupt conditions are run in parallel, it's possible to have multiple interrupts in the task queue. For example, the following graph has two nodes run in parallel that require human input: Once your graph has been interrupted and is stalled, you can resume all the interrupts at once with Command.resume, passing a dictionary mapping of interrupt ids to resume values. from typing import TypedDict import uuid from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver from langgraph.constants import START from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command class State ( TypedDict ): text_1 : str text_2 : str def human_node_1 ( state : State ): value = interrupt ({ \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"text_1\" ]}) return { \"text_1\" : value } def human_node_2 ( state : State ): value = interrupt ({ \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"text_2\" ]}) return { \"text_2\" : value } graph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_node_1\" , human_node_1 ) graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_node_2\" , human_node_2 ) # Add both nodes in parallel from START graph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"human_node_1\" ) graph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"human_node_2\" ) checkpointer = InMemorySaver () graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) thread_id = str ( uuid . uuid4 ()) config : RunnableConfig = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : thread_id }} result = graph . invoke ( { \"text_1\" : \"original text 1\" , \"text_2\" : \"original text 2\" }, config = config ) # Resume with mapping of interrupt IDs to values resume_map = { i . id : f \"edited text for { i . value [ 'text_to_revise' ] } \" for i in graph . get_state ( config ) . interrupts } print ( graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = resume_map ), config = config )) # > {'text_1': 'edited text for original text 1', 'text_2': 'edited text for original text 2'} Common patterns Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using interrupt and Command. Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. from typing import Literal from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command def human_approval ( state : State ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"some_node\" , \"another_node\" ]]: is_approved = interrupt ( { \"question\" : \"Is this correct?\" , # Surface the output that should be # reviewed and approved by the human. \"llm_output\" : state [ \"llm_output\" ] } ) if is_approved : return Command ( goto = \"some_node\" ) else : return Command ( goto = \"another_node\" ) # Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location # and connect it to the relevant nodes. graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_approval\" , human_approval ) graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) # After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause. # Resume it with either an approval or rejection. thread_config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"some_id\" }} graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = True ), config = thread_config ) from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_editing ( state : State ): ... result = interrupt ( # Interrupt information to surface to the client. # Can be any JSON serializable value. { \"task\" : \"Review the output from the LLM and make any necessary edits.\" , \"llm_generated_summary\" : state [ \"llm_generated_summary\" ] } ) # Update the state with the edited text return { \"llm_generated_summary\" : result [ \"edited_text\" ] } # Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location # and connect it to the relevant nodes. graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_editing\" , human_editing ) graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) ... # After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause. # Resume it with the edited text. thread_config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"some_id\" }} graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = { \"edited_text\" : \"The edited text\" }), config = thread_config ) from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver from langgraph.types import interrupt from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent # An example of a sensitive tool that requires human review / approval def book_hotel ( hotel_name : str ): \"\"\"Book a hotel\"\"\" response = interrupt ( f \"Trying to call `book_hotel` with args {{ 'hotel_name': { hotel_name } }} . \" \"Please approve or suggest edits.\" ) if response [ \"type\" ] == \"accept\" : pass elif response [ \"type\" ] == \"edit\" : hotel_name = response [ \"args\" ][ \"hotel_name\" ] else : raise ValueError ( f \"Unknown response type: { response [ 'type' ] } \" ) return f \"Successfully booked a stay at { hotel_name } .\" checkpointer = InMemorySaver () agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ book_hotel ], checkpointer = checkpointer , ) Run the agent with the stream() method, passing the config object to specify the thread ID. This allows the agent to resume the same conversation on future invocations. config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"1\" } } for chunk in agent.stream( {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"book a stay at McKittrick hotel\"}]}, config ): print(chunk) print(\"\\n\") You should see that the agent runs until it reaches the interrupt() call, at which point it pauses and waits for human input. Resume the agent with a Command to continue based on human input. from langgraph.types import Command for chunk in agent . stream ( Command ( resume = { \"type\" : \"accept\" }), # Command(resume={\"type\": \"edit\", \"args\": {\"hotel_name\": \"McKittrick Hotel\"}}), config ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Add interrupts to any tool You can create a wrapper to add interrupts to any tool. The example below provides a reference implementation compatible with Agent Inbox UI and Agent Chat UI. Wrapper that adds human-in-the-loop to any tool from typing import Callable from langchain_core.tools import BaseTool , tool as create_tool from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.types import interrupt from langgraph.prebuilt.interrupt import HumanInterruptConfig , HumanInterrupt def add_human_in_the_loop ( tool : Callable | BaseTool , * , interrupt_config : HumanInterruptConfig = None , ) -> BaseTool : \"\"\"Wrap a tool to support human-in-the-loop review.\"\"\" if not isinstance ( tool , BaseTool ): tool = create_tool ( tool ) if interrupt_config is None : interrupt_config = { \"allow_accept\" : True , \"allow_edit\" : True , \"allow_respond\" : True , } @create_tool ( tool . name , description = tool . description , args_schema = tool . args_schema ) def call_tool_with_interrupt ( config : RunnableConfig , ** tool_input ): request : HumanInterrupt = { \"action_request\" : { \"action\" : tool . name , \"args\" : tool_input }, \"config\" : interrupt_config , \"description\" : \"Please review the tool call\" } response = interrupt ([ request ])[ 0 ] # approve the tool call if response [ \"type\" ] == \"accept\" : tool_response = tool . invoke ( tool_input , config ) # update tool call args elif response [ \"type\" ] == \"edit\" : tool_input = response [ \"args\" ][ \"args\" ] tool_response = tool . invoke ( tool_input , config ) # respond to the LLM with user feedback elif response [ \"type\" ] == \"response\" : user_feedback = response [ \"args\" ] tool_response = user_feedback else : raise ValueError ( f \"Unsupported interrupt response type: { response [ 'type' ] } \" ) return tool_response return call_tool_with_interrupt You can use the wrapper to add interrupt() to any tool without having to add it inside the tool: from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent checkpointer = InMemorySaver () def book_hotel ( hotel_name : str ): \"\"\"Book a hotel\"\"\" return f \"Successfully booked a stay at { hotel_name } .\" agent = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ add_human_in_the_loop ( book_hotel ), ], checkpointer = checkpointer , ) config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"1\" }} # Run the agent for chunk in agent . stream ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"book a stay at McKittrick hotel\" }]}, config ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Validate human input If you need to validate the input provided by the human within the graph itself (rather than on the client side), you can achieve this by using multiple interrupt calls within a single node. from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_node ( state : State ): \"\"\"Human node with validation.\"\"\" question = \"What is your age?\" while True : answer = interrupt ( question ) # Validate answer, if the answer isn't valid ask for input again. if not isinstance ( answer , int ) or answer < 0 : question = f \"' { answer } is not a valid age. What is your age?\" answer = None continue else : # If the answer is valid, we can proceed. break print ( f \"The human in the loop is { answer } years old.\" ) return { \"age\" : answer } Debug with interrupts To debug and test a graph, use static interrupts (also known as static breakpoints) to step through the graph execution one node at a time or to pause the graph execution at specific nodes. Static interrupts are triggered at defined points either before or after a node executes. You can set static interrupts by specifying interrupt_before and interrupt_after at compile time or run time. Static interrupts are not recommended for human-in-the-loop workflows. Use dynamic interrupts instead. compile time graph = graph_builder.compile( interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"], interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"], checkpointer=checkpointer, ) config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\" } } # Run the graph until the breakpoint graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config) # Resume the graph graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config) Run time graph.invoke( inputs, interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"], interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"] config={ \"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"some_thread\"} }, ) config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\" } } # Run the graph until the breakpoint graph.invoke(inputs, config=config) # Resume the graph graph.invoke(None, config=config) You cannot set static breakpoints at runtime for sub-graphs. If you have a sub-graph, you must set the breakpoints at compilation time. Use static interrupts in LangGraph Studio You can use LangGraph Studio to debug your graph. You can set static breakpoints in the UI and then run the graph. You can also use the UI to inspect the graph state at any point in the execution. LangGraph Studio is free with locally deployed applications using langgraph dev. Considerations When using human-in-the-loop, there are some considerations to keep in mind. Using with code with side-effects Place code with side effects, such as API calls, after the interrupt or in a separate node to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. Side effects after interrupt from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_node ( state : State ): \"\"\"Human node with validation.\"\"\" answer = interrupt ( question ) api_call ( answer ) # OK as it's after the interrupt Side effects in a separate node from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_node ( state : State ): \"\"\"Human node with validation.\"\"\" answer = interrupt ( question ) return { \"answer\" : answer } def api_call_node ( state : State ): api_call ( ... ) # OK as it's in a separate node Using with subgraphs called as functions When invoking a subgraph as a function, the parent graph will resume execution from the beginning of the node where the subgraph was invoked where the interrupt was triggered. Similarly, the subgraph will resume from the beginning of the node where the interrupt() function was called. def node_in_parent_graph ( state : State ) : some_code () # <-- This will re-execute when the subgraph is resumed. # Invoke a subgraph as a function. # The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call. subgraph_result = subgraph . invoke ( some_input ) ... Using multiple interrupts in a single node Using multiple interrupts within a single node can be helpful for patterns like validating human input. However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is strictly index-based, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical. To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via Command(resume=..., update=SOME_STATE_MUTATION) or relying on global variables to modify the node's structure dynamically. Time Travel # When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail: \ud83e\udd14 Understand reasoning: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result. \ud83d\udc1e Debug mistakes: Identify where and why errors occurred. \ud83d\udd0d Explore alternatives: Test different paths to uncover better solutions. LangGraph provides time travel functionality to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint \u2014 either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history. Use time-travel To use time-travel in LangGraph: Run the graph with initial inputs using invoke or stream methods. Identify a checkpoint in an existing thread: Use the get_state_history() method to retrieve the execution history for a specific thread_id and locate the desired checkpoint_id. Alternatively, set an interrupt before the node(s) where you want execution to pause. You can then find the most recent checkpoint recorded up to that interrupt. **Update the graph state (optional): Use the update_state method to modify the graph's state at the checkpoint and resume execution from alternative state. Resume execution from the checkpoint: Use the invoke or stream methods with an input of None and a configuration containing the appropriate thread_id and checkpoint_id. In a workflow This example builds a simple LangGraph workflow that generates a joke topic and writes a joke using an LLM. It demonstrates how to run the graph, retrieve past execution checkpoints, optionally modify the state, and resume execution from a chosen checkpoint to explore alternate outcomes.

Subgraphs allow you to build complex systems with multiple components that are themselves graphs. Some reasons for using subgraphs are: building multi-agent systems when you want to reuse a set of nodes in multiple graphs when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph The main question when adding subgraphs is how the parent graph and subgraph communicate, i.e. how they pass the state between each other during the graph execution. There are two scenarios: parent and subgraph have shared state keys in their state schemas. In this case, you can include the subgraph as a node in the parent graph from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START # Subgraph def call_model ( state : MessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( state [ \"messages\" ]) return { \"messages\" : response } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( call_model ) ... subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"subgraph_node\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node\" ) graph = builder . compile () ... graph . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"hi!\" }]}) parent graph and subgraph have different schemas (no shared state keys in their state schemas). In this case, you have to call the subgraph from inside a node in the parent graph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state before or after calling the subgraph from typing_extensions import TypedDict , Annotated from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages class SubgraphMessagesState ( TypedDict ): subgraph_messages : Annotated [ list [ AnyMessage ], add_messages ] # Subgraph def call_model ( state : SubgraphMessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( state [ \"subgraph_messages\" ]) return { \"subgraph_messages\" : response } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphMessagesState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( \"call_model_from_subgraph\" , call_model ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"call_model_from_subgraph\" ) ... subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph def call_subgraph ( state : MessagesState ): response = subgraph . invoke ({ \"subgraph_messages\" : state [ \"messages\" ]}) return { \"messages\" : response [ \"subgraph_messages\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"subgraph_node\" , call_subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node\" ) graph = builder . compile () ... graph . invoke ({ \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"hi!\" }]}) Use subgraphs # This guide explains the mechanics of using subgraphs. A common application of subgraphs is to build multi-agent systems. When adding subgraphs, you need to define how the parent graph and the subgraph communicate: Shared state schemas \u2014 parent and subgraph have shared state keys in their state schemas Different state schemas \u2014 no shared state keys in parent and subgraph schemas Setup pip install -U langgraph Shared state schemas A common case is for the parent graph and subgraph to communicate over a shared state key (channel) in the schema. For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key. If your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph: Define the subgraph workflow ( subgraph_builder in the example below) and compile it Pass compiled subgraph to the .add_node method when defining the parent graph workflow from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : State ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) graph = builder . compile () Full example: shared state schemas from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START # Define subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): foo : str bar : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"bar\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo') return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : ParentState ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( ParentState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) graph = builder . compile () for chunk in graph . stream ({ \"foo\" : \"foo\" }): print ( chunk ) Different state schemas For more complex systems you might want to define subgraphs that have a completely different schema from the parent graph (no shared keys). For example, you might want to keep a private message history for each of the agents in a multi-agent system. If that's the case for your application, you need to define a node function that invokes the subgraph . This function needs to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node. from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): bar : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str def call_subgraph ( state : State ): subgraph_output = subgraph . invoke ({ \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ]}) return { \"foo\" : subgraph_output [ \"bar\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , call_subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) graph = builder . compile () Full example: different state schemas from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START # Define subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state bar : str baz : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"baz\" : \"baz\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : state [ \"bar\" ] + state [ \"baz\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : ParentState ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} def node_2 ( state : ParentState ): response = subgraph . invoke ({ \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ]}) return { \"foo\" : response [ \"bar\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( ParentState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , node_2 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) graph = builder . compile () for chunk in graph . stream ({ \"foo\" : \"foo\" }, subgraphs = True ): print ( chunk ) Full example: different state schemas (two levels of subgraphs) # Grandchild graph from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START , END class GrandChildState ( TypedDict ): my_grandchild_key : str def grandchild_1 ( state : GrandChildState ) -> GrandChildState : # NOTE: child or parent keys will not be accessible here return { \"my_grandchild_key\" : state [ \"my_grandchild_key\" ] + \", how are you\" } grandchild = StateGraph ( GrandChildState ) grandchild . add_node ( \"grandchild_1\" , grandchild_1 ) grandchild . add_edge ( START , \"grandchild_1\" ) grandchild . add_edge ( \"grandchild_1\" , END ) grandchild_graph = grandchild . compile () # Child graph class ChildState ( TypedDict ): my_child_key : str def call_grandchild_graph ( state : ChildState ) -> ChildState : # NOTE: parent or grandchild keys won't be accessible here grandchild_graph_input = { \"my_grandchild_key\" : state [ \"my_child_key\" ]} grandchild_graph_output = grandchild_graph . invoke ( grandchild_graph_input ) return { \"my_child_key\" : grandchild_graph_output [ \"my_grandchild_key\" ] + \" today?\" } child = StateGraph ( ChildState ) child . add_node ( \"child_1\" , call_grandchild_graph ) child . add_edge ( START , \"child_1\" ) child . add_edge ( \"child_1\" , END ) child_graph = child . compile () # Parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): my_key : str def parent_1 ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : # NOTE: child or grandchild keys won't be accessible here return { \"my_key\" : \"hi \" + state [ \"my_key\" ]} def parent_2 ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : return { \"my_key\" : state [ \"my_key\" ] + \" bye!\" } def call_child_graph ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : child_graph_input = { \"my_child_key\" : state [ \"my_key\" ]} child_graph_output = child_graph . invoke ( child_graph_input ) return { \"my_key\" : child_graph_output [ \"my_child_key\" ]} parent = StateGraph ( ParentState ) parent . add_node ( \"parent_1\" , parent_1 ) parent . add_node ( \"child\" , call_child_graph ) parent . add_node ( \"parent_2\" , parent_2 ) parent . add_edge ( START , \"parent_1\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"parent_1\" , \"child\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"child\" , \"parent_2\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"parent_2\" , END ) parent_graph = parent . compile () for chunk in parent_graph . stream ({ \"my_key\" : \"Bob\" }, subgraphs = True ): print ( chunk ) Add persistence You only need to provide the checkpointer when compiling the parent graph . LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. from langgraph.graph import START , StateGraph from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from typing_extensions import TypedDict class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : State ): return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + \"bar\" } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) checkpointer = MemorySaver () graph = builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) If you want the subgraph to have its own memory, you can compile it with the appropriate checkpointer option. This is useful in multi-agent systems, if you want agents to keep track of their internal message histories: subgraph_builder = StateGraph(...) subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile(checkpointer=True) View subgraph state When you enable persistence, you can inspect the graph state (checkpoint) via the appropriate method. To view the subgraph state, you can use the subgraphs option. You can inspect the graph state via graph.get_state(config) . To view the subgraph state, you can use graph.get_state(config, subgraphs=True) . Subgraph state can only be viewed when the subgraph is interrupted. Once you resume the graph, you won't be able to access the subgraph state. View interrupted subgraph state from langgraph.graph import START , StateGraph from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command from typing_extensions import TypedDict class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : State ): value = interrupt ( \"Provide value:\" ) return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + value } subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) checkpointer = MemorySaver () graph = builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"1\" }} graph . invoke ({ \"foo\" : \"\" }, config ) parent_state = graph . get_state ( config ) subgraph_state = graph . get_state ( config , subgraphs = True ) . tasks [ 0 ] . state # resume the subgraph graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = \"bar\" ), config ) Stream subgraph outputs To include outputs from subgraphs in the streamed outputs, you can set the subgraphs option in the stream method of the parent graph. This will stream outputs from both the parent graph and any subgraphs. for chunk in graph.stream( {\"foo\": \"foo\"}, subgraphs=True, stream_mode=\"updates\", ): print(chunk) Stream from subgraphs from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START # Define subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): foo : str bar : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"bar\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo') return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : ParentState ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( ParentState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) graph = builder . compile () for chunk in graph . stream ( { \"foo\" : \"foo\" }, stream_mode = \"updates\" , subgraphs = True , ): print ( chunk ) Multi-agent systems # An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. As you develop these systems, they might grow more complex over time, making them harder to manage and scale. For example, you might run into the following problems: agent has too many tools at its disposal and makes poor decisions about which tool to call next context grows too complex for a single agent to keep track of there is a need for multiple specialization areas in the system (e.g. planner, researcher, math expert, etc.) To tackle these, you might consider breaking your application into multiple smaller, independent agents and composing them into a multi-agent system .These independent agents can be as simple as a prompt and an LLM call, or as complex as a ReAct agent (and more!). The primary benefits of using multi-agent systems are: Modularity: Separate agents make it easier to develop, test, and maintain agentic systems. Specialization: You can create expert agents focused on specific domains, which helps with the overall system performance. Control: You can explicitly control how agents communicate (as opposed to relying on function calling). Multi-agent architectures # There are several ways to connect agents in a multi-agent system: Network: each agent can communicate with every other agent. Any agent can decide which other agent to call next. Supervisor: each agent communicates with a single supervisor agent. Supervisor agent makes decisions on which agent should be called next. Supervisor (tool-calling): this is a special case of supervisor architecture. Individual agents can be represented as tools. In this case, a supervisor agent uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which of the agent tools to call, as well as the arguments to pass to those agents. Hierarchical: you can define a multi-agent system with a supervisor of supervisors. This is a generalization of the supervisor architecture and allows for more complex control flows. Custom multi-agent workflow: each agent communicates with only a subset of agents. Parts of the flow are deterministic, and only some agents can decide which other agents to call next. Handoffs In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs , where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify: destination: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the node to go to) payload: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update) To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return Command object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates: def agent ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent\" , \"another_agent\" ]]: # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc. goto = get_next_agent ( ... ) # 'agent' / 'another_agent' return Command ( # Specify which agent to call next goto = goto , # Update the graph state update = { \"my_state_key\" : \"my_state_value\" } ) In a more complex scenario where each agent node is itself a graph (i.e., a subgraph), a node in one of the agent subgraphs might want to navigate to a different agent. For example, if you have two agents, alice and bob (subgraph nodes in a parent graph), and alice needs to navigate to bob, you can set graph=Command.PARENT in the Command object: def some_node_inside_alice(state): return Command( goto=\"bob\", update={\"my_state_key\": \"my_state_value\"}, # specify which graph to navigate to (defaults to the current graph) graph=Command.PARENT, ) If you need to support visualization for subgraphs communicating using Command(graph=Command.PARENT) you would need to wrap them in a node function with Command annotation: Instead of this: builder.add_node(alice) you would need to do this: def call_alice ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"bob\" ]] : return alice . invoke ( state ) builder . add_node ( \"alice\" , call_alice ) Handoffs as tools One of the most common agent types is a tool-calling agent. For those types of agents, a common pattern is wrapping a handoff in a tool call: from langchain_core.tools import tool @tool def transfer_to_bob (): \"\"\"Transfer to bob.\"\"\" return Command ( # name of the agent (node) to go to goto = \"bob\" , # data to send to the agent update = { \"my_state_key\" : \"my_state_value\" }, # indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to # agent node in a parent graph graph = Command . PARENT , ) This is a special case of updating the graph state from tools where, in addition to the state update, the control flow is included as well. If you want to use tools that return Command, you can use the prebuilt create_react_agent / ToolNode components, or else implement your own logic: def call_tools ( state ): ... commands = [ tools_by_name [ tool_call [ \"name\" ]] . invoke ( tool_call ) for tool_call in tool_calls ] return commands Network In this architecture, agents are defined as graph nodes. Each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. This architecture is good for problems that do not have a clear hierarchy of agents or a specific sequence in which agents should be called. from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.types import Command from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END model = ChatOpenAI () def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_2\" , \"agent_3\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_agent\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the agents or exit based on the LLM's decision # if the LLM returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_3\" , END ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) def agent_3 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" , END ]]: ... return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) builder . add_node ( agent_3 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"agent_1\" ) network = builder . compile () Supervisor In this architecture, we define agents as nodes and add a supervisor node (LLM) that decides which agent nodes should be called next. We use Command to route execution to the appropriate agent node based on supervisor's decision. This architecture also lends itself well to running multiple agents in parallel or using map-reduce pattern . from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.types import Command from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END model = ChatOpenAI () def supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_agent\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the agents or exit based on the supervisor's decision # if the supervisor returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ]) def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"supervisor\" ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.) response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}, ) def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}, ) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( supervisor ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"supervisor\" ) supervisor = builder . compile () Supervisor (tool-calling) In this variant of the supervisor architecture, we define a supervisor agent which is responsible for calling sub-agents. The sub-agents are exposed to the supervisor as tools, and the supervisor agent decides which tool to call next. The supervisor agent follows a standard implementation as an LLM running in a while loop calling tools until it decides to stop. from typing import Annotated from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState , create_react_agent model = ChatOpenAI () # this is the agent function that will be called as tool # notice that you can pass the state to the tool via InjectedState annotation def agent_1 ( state : Annotated [ dict , InjectedState ]): # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # return the LLM response as a string (expected tool response format) # this will be automatically turned to ToolMessage # by the prebuilt create_react_agent (supervisor) return response . content def agent_2 ( state : Annotated [ dict , InjectedState ]): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return response . content tools = [ agent_1 , agent_2 ] # the simplest way to build a supervisor w/ tool-calling is to use prebuilt ReAct agent graph # that consists of a tool-calling LLM node (i.e. supervisor) and a tool-executing node supervisor = create_react_agent ( model , tools ) Hierarchical As you add more agents to your system, it might become too hard for the supervisor to manage all of them. The supervisor might start making poor decisions about which agent to call next, or the context might become too complex for a single supervisor to keep track of. In other words, you end up with the same problems that motivated the multi-agent architecture in the first place. To address this, you can design your system hierarchically. For example, you can create separate, specialized teams of agents managed by individual supervisors, and a top-level supervisor to manage the teams. from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END from langgraph.types import Command model = ChatOpenAI () # define team 1 (same as the single supervisor example above) def team_1_supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_agent_1\" , \"team_1_agent_2\" , END ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ]) def team_1_agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"team_1_supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}) def team_1_agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"team_1_supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}) team_1_builder = StateGraph ( Team1State ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_supervisor ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_agent_1 ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_agent_2 ) team_1_builder . add_edge ( START , \"team_1_supervisor\" ) team_1_graph = team_1_builder . compile () # define team 2 (same as the single supervisor example above) class Team2State ( MessagesState ): next : Literal [ \"team_2_agent_1\" , \"team_2_agent_2\" , \"__end__\" ] def team_2_supervisor ( state : Team2State ): ... def team_2_agent_1 ( state : Team2State ): ... def team_2_agent_2 ( state : Team2State ): ... team_2_builder = StateGraph ( Team2State ) ... team_2_graph = team_2_builder . compile () # define top-level supervisor builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) def top_level_supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_graph\" , \"team_2_graph\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which team to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_team\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the teams or exit based on the supervisor's decision # if the supervisor returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_team\" ]) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( top_level_supervisor ) builder . add_node ( \"team_1_graph\" , team_1_graph ) builder . add_node ( \"team_2_graph\" , team_2_graph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"team_1_graph\" , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"team_2_graph\" , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) graph = builder . compile () Custom multi-agent workflow In this architecture we add individual agents as graph nodes and define the order in which agents are called ahead of time, in a custom workflow. In LangGraph the workflow can be defined in two ways: Explicit control flow (normal edges): LangGraph allows you to explicitly define the control flow of your application (i.e. the sequence of how agents communicate) explicitly, via normal graph edges. This is the most deterministic variant of this architecture above \u2014 we always know which agent will be called next ahead of time. Dynamic control flow (Command): in LangGraph you can allow LLMs to decide parts of your application control flow. This can be achieved by using Command. A special case of this is a supervisor tool-calling architecture. In that case, the tool-calling LLM powering the supervisor agent will make decisions about the order in which the tools (agents) are being called. from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START model = ChatOpenAI () def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) # define the flow explicitly builder . add_edge ( START , \"agent_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" ) Communication and state management The most important thing when building multi-agent systems is figuring out how the agents communicate. Handoffs vs tool calls What is the \"payload\" that is being passed around between agents? In most of the architectures discussed above, the agents communicate via handoffs and pass the graph state as part of the handoff payload. Specifically, agents pass around lists of messages as part of the graph state. In the case of the supervisor with tool-calling, the payloads are tool call arguments. Message passing between agents The most common way for agents to communicate is via a shared state channel, typically a list of messages. This assumes that there is always at least a single channel (key) in the state that is shared by the agents (e.g., messages). When communicating via a shared message list, there is an additional consideration: should the agents share the full history of their thought process or only the final result? Sharing full thought process Agents can share the full history of their thought process (i.e., \"scratchpad\") with all other agents. This \"scratchpad\" would typically look like a list of messages. The benefit of sharing the full thought process is that it might help other agents make better decisions and improve reasoning ability for the system as a whole. The downside is that as the number of agents and their complexity grows, the \"scratchpad\" will grow quickly and might require additional strategies for memory management. Sharing only final results Agents can have their own private \"scratchpad\" and only share the final result with the rest of the agents. This approach might work better for systems with many agents or agents that are more complex. In this case, you would need to define agents with different state schemas. For agents called as tools, the supervisor determines the inputs based on the tool schema. Additionally, LangGraph allows passing state to individual tools at runtime, so subordinate agents can access parent state, if needed. Indicating agent name in messages It can be helpful to indicate which agent a particular AI message is from, especially for long message histories. Some LLM providers (like OpenAI) support adding a name parameter to messages \u2014 you can use that to attach the agent name to the message. If that is not supported, you can consider manually injecting the agent name into the message content, e.g., alice message from alice . Multi-agent # A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and compose them into a multi-agent system. In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via handoffs \u2014 a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent. Two of the most popular multi-agent architectures are: supervisor \u2014 individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements. swarm \u2014 agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent. Use langgraph-supervisor library to create a supervisor multi-agent system: pip install langgraph-supervisor from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor def book_hotel ( hotel_name : str ): \"\"\"Book a hotel\"\"\" return f \"Successfully booked a stay at { hotel_name } .\" def book_flight ( from_airport : str , to_airport : str ): \"\"\"Book a flight\"\"\" return f \"Successfully booked a flight from { from_airport } to { to_airport } .\" flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"openai:gpt-4o\" , tools = [ book_flight ], prompt = \"You are a flight booking assistant\" , name = \"flight_assistant\" ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"openai:gpt-4o\" , tools = [ book_hotel ], prompt = \"You are a hotel booking assistant\" , name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) supervisor = create_supervisor ( agents = [ flight_assistant , hotel_assistant ], model = ChatOpenAI ( model = \"gpt-4o\" ), prompt = ( \"You manage a hotel booking assistant and a\" \"flight booking assistant. Assign work to them.\" ) ) . compile () for chunk in supervisor . stream ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel\" } ] } ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Use langgraph-swarm library to create a swarm multi-agent system: pip install langgraph-swarm from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph_swarm import create_swarm , create_handoff_tool transfer_to_hotel_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"hotel_assistant\" , description = \"Transfer user to the hotel-booking assistant.\" , ) transfer_to_flight_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"flight_assistant\" , description = \"Transfer user to the flight-booking assistant.\" , ) flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ book_flight , transfer_to_hotel_assistant ], prompt = \"You are a flight booking assistant\" , name = \"flight_assistant\" ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ book_hotel , transfer_to_flight_assistant ], prompt = \"You are a hotel booking assistant\" , name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) swarm = create_swarm ( agents = [ flight_assistant , hotel_assistant ], default_active_agent = \"flight_assistant\" ) . compile () for chunk in swarm . stream ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel\" } ] } ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Handoffs A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify: destination: target agent to navigate to payload: information to pass to that agent This is used both by langgraph-supervisor (supervisor hands off to individual agents) and langgraph-swarm (an individual agent can hand off to other agents). To implement handoffs with create_react_agent , you need to: Create a special tool that can transfer control to a different agent def transfer_to_bob () : \"\"\"Transfer to bob.\"\"\" return Command ( # name of the agent ( node ) to go to goto = \"bob\" , # data to send to the agent update = { \"messages\" : [ ... ] } , # indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to # agent node in a parent graph graph = Command . PARENT , ) Create individual agents that have access to handoff tools: flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( ... , tools = [ book_flight , transfer_to_hotel_assistant ] ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( ... , tools = [ book_hotel , transfer_to_flight_assistant ] ) Define a parent graph that contains individual agents as nodes: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState multi_agent_graph = ( StateGraph ( MessagesState ) . add_node ( flight_assistant ) . add_node ( hotel_assistant ) ... ) Putting this together, here is how you can implement a simple multi-agent system with two agents \u2014 a flight booking assistant and a hotel booking assistant: from typing import Annotated from langchain_core.tools import tool , InjectedToolCallId from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent , InjectedState from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , MessagesState from langgraph.types import Command def create_handoff_tool ( * , agent_name : str , description : str | None = None ): name = f \"transfer_to_ { agent_name } \" description = description or f \"Transfer to { agent_name } \" @tool ( name , description = description ) def handoff_tool ( state : Annotated [ MessagesState , InjectedState ], tool_call_id : Annotated [ str , InjectedToolCallId ], ) -> Command : tool_message = { \"role\" : \"tool\" , \"content\" : f \"Successfully transferred to { agent_name } \" , \"name\" : name , \"tool_call_id\" : tool_call_id , } return Command ( goto = agent_name , update = { \"messages\" : state [ \"messages\" ] + [ tool_message ]}, graph = Command .

PARENT , ) return handoff_tool Control agent inputs You can use the Send() primitive to directly send data to the worker agents during the handoff. For example, you can request that the calling agent populate a task description for the next agent: from typing import Annotated from langchain_core.tools import tool , InjectedToolCallId from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , MessagesState from langgraph.types import Command , Send def create_task_description_handoff_tool ( * , agent_name : str , description : str | None = None ): name = f \"transfer_to_ { agent_name } \" description = description or f \"Ask { agent_name } for help.\" @tool ( name , description = description ) def handoff_tool ( # this is populated by the calling agent task_description : Annotated [ str , \"Description of what the next agent should do, including all of the relevant context.\" , ], # these parameters are ignored by the LLM state : Annotated [ MessagesState , InjectedState ], ) -> Command : task_description_message = { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : task_description } agent_input = { ** state , \"messages\" : [ task_description_message ]} return Command ( goto = [ Send ( agent_name , agent_input )], graph = Command . PARENT , ) return handoff_tool Build a multi-agent system You can use handoffs in any agents built with LangGraph. We recommend using the prebuilt agent or ToolNode, as they natively support handoffs tools returning Command. Below is an example of how you can implement a multi-agent system for booking travel using handoffs: from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , MessagesState def create_handoff_tool ( * , agent_name : str , description : str | None = None ): # same implementation as above ... return Command ( ... ) # Handoffs transfer_to_hotel_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) transfer_to_flight_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"flight_assistant\" ) # Define agents flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ ... , transfer_to_hotel_assistant ], name = \"flight_assistant\" ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ ... , transfer_to_flight_assistant ], name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) # Define multi-agent graph multi_agent_graph = ( StateGraph ( MessagesState ) . add_node ( flight_assistant ) . add_node ( hotel_assistant ) . add_edge ( START , \"flight_assistant\" ) . compile () ) Full example: Multi-agent system for booking travel from typing import Annotated from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages from langchain_core.tools import tool , InjectedToolCallId from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent , InjectedState from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , MessagesState from langgraph.types import Command # We'll use `pretty_print_messages` helper to render the streamed agent outputs nicely def pretty_print_message ( message , indent = False ): pretty_message = message . pretty_repr ( html = True ) if not indent : print ( pretty_message ) return indented = \" \\n \" . join ( \" \\t \" + c for c in pretty_message . split ( \" \\n \" )) print ( indented ) def pretty_print_messages ( update , last_message = False ): is_subgraph = False if isinstance ( update , tuple ): ns , update = update # skip parent graph updates in the printouts if len ( ns ) == 0 : return graph_id = ns [ - 1 ] . split ( \":\" )[ 0 ] print ( f \"Update from subgraph { graph_id } :\" ) print ( \" \\n \" ) is_subgraph = True for node_name , node_update in update . items (): update_label = f \"Update from node { node_name } :\" if is_subgraph : update_label = \" \\t \" + update_label print ( update_label ) print ( \" \\n \" ) messages = convert_to_messages ( node_update [ \"messages\" ]) if last_message : messages = messages [ - 1 :] for m in messages : pretty_print_message ( m , indent = is_subgraph ) print ( \" \\n \" ) def create_handoff_tool ( * , agent_name : str , description : str | None = None ): name = f \"transfer_to_ { agent_name } \" description = description or f \"Transfer to { agent_name } \" @tool ( name , description = description ) def handoff_tool ( state : Annotated [ MessagesState , InjectedState ], tool_call_id : Annotated [ str , InjectedToolCallId ], ) -> Command : tool_message = { \"role\" : \"tool\" , \"content\" : f \"Successfully transferred to { agent_name } \" , \"name\" : name , \"tool_call_id\" : tool_call_id , } return Command ( goto = agent_name , update = { \"messages\" : state [ \"messages\" ] + [ tool_message ]}, graph = Command .

To build a system that can handle this, you can create a node that uses an interrupt to collect user input and routes back to the active agent. The agents can then be implemented as nodes in a graph that executes agent steps and determines the next action: Wait for user input to continue the conversation, or Route to another agent (or back to itself, such as in a loop) via a handoff def human ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent\" , \"another_agent\" ]]: \"\"\"A node for collecting user input.\"\"\" user_input = interrupt ( value = \"Ready for user input.\" ) # Determine the active agent. active_agent = ... ... return Command ( update = { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"human\" , \"content\" : user_input , }] }, goto = active_agent ) def agent ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent\" , \"another_agent\" , \"human\" ]]: # The condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc. goto = get_next_agent ( ... ) # 'agent' / 'another_agent' if goto : return Command ( goto = goto , update = { \"my_state_key\" : \"my_state_value\" }) else : return Command ( goto = \"human\" ) # Go to human node MCP # Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools and context to language models. LangGraph agents can use tools defined on MCP servers through the langchain-mcp-adapters library. Install the langchain-mcp-adapters library to use MCP tools in LangGraph: pip install langchain-mcp-adapters Use MCP tools The langchain-mcp-adapters package enables agents to use tools defined across one or more MCP servers. In an agent from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent client = MultiServerMCPClient ( { \"math\" : { \"command\" : \"python\" , # Replace with absolute path to your math_server.py file \"args\" : [ \"/path/to/math_server.py\" ], \"transport\" : \"stdio\" , }, \"weather\" : { # Ensure you start your weather server on port 8000 \"url\" : \"http://localhost:8000/mcp\" , \"transport\" : \"streamable_http\" , } } ) tools = await client . get_tools () agent = create_react_agent ( \"anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\" , tools ) math_response = await agent . ainvoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's (3 + 5) x 12?\" }]} ) weather_response = await agent . ainvoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what is the weather in nyc?\" }]} ) In a workflow from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode # Initialize the model model = init_chat_model ( \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" ) # Set up MCP client client = MultiServerMCPClient ( { \"math\" : { \"command\" : \"python\" , # Make sure to update to the full absolute path to your math_server.py file \"args\" : [ \"./examples/math_server.py\" ], \"transport\" : \"stdio\" , }, \"weather\" : { # make sure you start your weather server on port 8000 \"url\" : \"http://localhost:8000/mcp/\" , \"transport\" : \"streamable_http\" , } } ) tools = await client . get_tools () # Bind tools to model model_with_tools = model . bind_tools ( tools ) # Create ToolNode tool_node = ToolNode ( tools ) def should_continue ( state : MessagesState ): messages = state [ \"messages\" ] last_message = messages [ - 1 ] if last_message . tool_calls : return \"tools\" return END # Define call_model function async def call_model ( state : MessagesState ): messages = state [ \"messages\" ] response = await model_with_tools . ainvoke ( messages ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} # Build the graph builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( \"call_model\" , call_model ) builder . add_node ( \"tools\" , tool_node ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"call_model\" ) builder . add_conditional_edges ( \"call_model\" , should_continue , ) builder . add_edge ( \"tools\" , \"call_model\" ) # Compile the graph graph = builder . compile () # Test the graph math_response = await graph . ainvoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what's (3 + 5) x 12?\" }]} ) weather_response = await graph . ainvoke ( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what is the weather in nyc?\" }]} ) Custom MCP servers To create your own MCP servers, you can use the mcp library. This library provides a simple way to define tools and run them as servers. Install the MCP library: pip install mcp Use the following reference implementations to test your agent with MCP tool servers. Example Math Server (stdio transport) from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP mcp = FastMCP ( \"Math\" ) @mcp . tool () def add ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\" return a + b @mcp . tool () def multiply ( a : int , b : int ) -> int : \"\"\"Multiply two numbers\"\"\" return a * b if __name__ == \"__main__\" : mcp . run ( transport = \"stdio\" ) Example Weather Server (Streamable HTTP transport) from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP mcp = FastMCP ( \"Weather\" ) @mcp . tool () async def get_weather ( location : str ) -> str : \"\"\"Get weather for location.\"\"\" return \"It's always sunny in New York\" if __name__ == \"__main__\" : mcp . run ( transport = \"streamable-http\" ) Tracing # Traces are a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output. Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use LangSmith to visualize these execution steps. To use it, enable tracing for your application. This enables you to do the following: Enable tracing for your application export LANGSMITH_TRACING = true export LANGSMITH_API_KEY =< your - api - key > Evals # To evaluate your agent's performance you can use LangSmith evaluations. You would need to first define an evaluator function to judge the results from an agent, such as final outputs or trajectory. Depending on your evaluation technique, this may or may not involve a reference output: def evaluator(*, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict): # compare agent outputs against reference outputs output_messages = outputs[\"messages\"] reference_messages = reference_outputs[\"messages\"] score = compare_messages(output_messages, reference_messages) return {\"key\": \"evaluator_score\", \"score\": score} To get started, you can use prebuilt evaluators from AgentEvals package: pip install -U agentevals Create evaluator A common way to evaluate agent performance is by comparing its trajectory (the order in which it calls its tools) against a reference trajectory: import json from agentevals.trajectory.match import create_trajectory_match_evaluator outputs = [ { \"role\" : \"assistant\" , \"tool_calls\" : [ { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"city\" : \"san francisco\" }), } }, { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_directions\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"destination\" : \"presidio\" }), } } ], } ] reference_outputs = [ { \"role\" : \"assistant\" , \"tool_calls\" : [ { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"city\" : \"san francisco\" }), } }, ], } ] # Create the evaluator evaluator = create_trajectory_match_evaluator ( trajectory_match_mode = \"superset\" , ) # Run the evaluator result = evaluator ( outputs = outputs , reference_outputs = reference_outputs ) LLM-as-a-judge You can use LLM-as-a-judge evaluator that uses an LLM to compare the trajectory against the reference outputs and output a score: import json from agentevals.trajectory.llm import ( create_trajectory_llm_as_judge , TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE ) evaluator = create_trajectory_llm_as_judge ( prompt = TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE , model = \"openai:o3-mini\" ) Run evaluator To run an evaluator, you will first need to create a LangSmith dataset. To use the prebuilt AgentEvals evaluators, you will need a dataset with the following schema: input : {\"messages\": [...]} input messages to call the agent with. output : {\"messages\": [...]} expected message history in the agent output. For trajectory evaluation, you can choose to keep only assistant messages. from langsmith import Client from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from agentevals.trajectory.match import create_trajectory_match_evaluator client = Client () agent = create_react_agent ( ... ) evaluator = create_trajectory_match_evaluator ( ... ) experiment_results = client . evaluate ( lambda inputs : agent . invoke ( inputs ), # replace with your dataset name data = \"<Name of your dataset>\" , evaluators = [ evaluator ] ) Reference # !LangGraph","title":"LangGraph"},{"location":"AgenticAI/LangGraph.html#agent-architectures","text":"Many LLM applications implement a particular control flow of steps before and / or after LLM calls. As an example, RAG performs retrieval of documents relevant to a user question, and passes those documents to an LLM in order to ground the model's response in the provided document context. Instead of hard-coding a fixed control flow, we sometimes want LLM systems that can pick their own control flow to solve more complex problems! This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. There are many ways that an LLM can control application: An LLM can route between two potential paths An LLM can decide which of many tools to call An LLM can decide whether the generated answer is sufficient or more work is needed Router A router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options. This is an agent architecture that exhibits a relatively limited level of control because the LLM usually focuses on making a single decision and produces a specific output from a limited set of pre-defined options. Routers typically employ a few different concepts to achieve this. Structured Output Structured outputs with LLMs work by providing a specific format or schema that the LLM should follow in its response. This is similar to tool calling, but more general. While tool calling typically involves selecting and using predefined functions, structured outputs can be used for any type of formatted response. Common methods to achieve structured outputs include: Prompt engineering: Instructing the LLM to respond in a specific format via the system prompt. Output parsers: Using post-processing to extract structured data from LLM responses. Tool calling: Leveraging built-in tool calling capabilities of some LLMs to generate structured outputs. Tool-calling agent cWhile a router allows an LLM to make a single decision, more complex agent architectures expand the LLM's control in two key ways: Multi-step decision making: The LLM can make a series of decisions, one after another, instead of just one.

However, some use cases require models to interface directly with external systems\u2014such as APIs, databases, or file systems\u2014using structured input.

These can be passed to compatible chat models, allowing the model to decide whether to invoke a tool and with what arguments. Tool calling is typically conditional . Based on the user input and available tools, the model may choose to issue a tool call request. This request is returned in an AIMessage object, which includes a tool_calls field that specifies the tool name and input arguments: llm_with_tools . invoke ( \"What is 2 multiplied by 3?\" ) # -> AIMessage(tool_calls=[{'name': 'multiply', 'args': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}, ...}]) AIMessage ( tool_calls = [ ToolCall ( name = \"multiply\" , args = { \"a\" : 2 , \"b\" : 3 }), ... ] ) If the input is unrelated to any tool, the model returns only a natural language message: llm_with_tools . invoke ( \"Hello world!\" ) # -> AIMessage(content=\"Hello!\") Importantly, the model does not execute the tool\u2014it only generates a request.

This is especially useful in large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction, or additional context. Key capabilities Persistent execution state: Interrupts use LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the graph state, to indefinitely pause graph execution until you resume. This is possible because LangGraph checkpoints the graph state after each step, which allows the system to persist execution context and later resume the workflow, continuing from where it left off. This supports asynchronous human review or input without time constraints. There are two ways to pause a graph: Dynamic interrupts: Use interrupt to pause a graph from inside a specific node, based on the current state of the graph. Static interrupts: Use interrupt_before and interrupt_after to pause the graph at pre-defined points, either before or after a node executes. Flexible integration points: Human-in-the-loop logic can be introduced at any point in the workflow. This allows targeted human involvement, such as approving API calls, correcting outputs, or guiding conversations. Patterns There are four typical design patterns that you can implement using interrupt and Command : Approve or reject: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involves routing the graph based on the human's input. Edit graph state: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves updating the state with the human's input. Review tool calls: Pause the graph to review and edit tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution. Validate human input: Pause the graph to validate human input before proceeding with the next step.","title":"Human-in-the-loop"},{"location":"AgenticAI/LangGraph.html#enable-human-intervention","text":"To review, edit, and approve tool calls in an agent or workflow, use interrupts to pause a graph and wait for human input. Interrupts use LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the graph state, to indefinitely pause graph execution until you resume. Pause using interrupt Dynamic interrupts (also known as dynamic breakpoints) are triggered based on the current state of the graph. You can set dynamic interrupts by calling interrupt function in the appropriate place. The graph will pause, which allows for human intervention, and then resumes the graph with their input. It's useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or gathering additional context. To use interrupt in your graph, you need to: Specify a checkpointer to save the graph state after each step. Call interrupt() in the appropriate place. See the Common Patterns section for examples. Run the graph with a thread ID until the interrupt is hit. Resume execution using invoke/stream from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command def human_node ( state : State ): value = interrupt ( { \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"some_text\" ] } ) return { \"some_text\" : value } graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) # Run the graph until the interrupt is hit. config = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : \"some_id\" }} result = graph . invoke ({ \"some_text\" : \"original text\" }, config = config ) print ( result [ '__interrupt__' ]) # > [ # > Interrupt( # > value={'text_to_revise': 'original text'}, # > resumable=True, # > ns=['human_node:6ce9e64f-edef-fe5d-f7dc-511fa9526960'] # > ) # > ] print ( graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = \"Edited text\" ), config = config )) # > {'some_text': 'Edited text'} When the interrupt function is used within a graph, execution pauses at that point and awaits user input. To resume execution, use the Command primitive, which can be supplied via the invoke or stream methods. The graph resumes execution from the beginning of the node where interrupt(...) was initially called. This time, the interrupt function will return the value provided in Command(resume=value) rather than pausing again. All code from the beginning of the node to the interrupt will be re-executed. # Resume graph execution by providing the user's input. graph.invoke(Command(resume={\"age\": \"25\"}), thread_config) Resume multiple interrupts with one invocation When nodes with interrupt conditions are run in parallel, it's possible to have multiple interrupts in the task queue. For example, the following graph has two nodes run in parallel that require human input: Once your graph has been interrupted and is stalled, you can resume all the interrupts at once with Command.resume, passing a dictionary mapping of interrupt ids to resume values. from typing import TypedDict import uuid from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver from langgraph.constants import START from langgraph.graph import StateGraph from langgraph.types import interrupt , Command class State ( TypedDict ): text_1 : str text_2 : str def human_node_1 ( state : State ): value = interrupt ({ \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"text_1\" ]}) return { \"text_1\" : value } def human_node_2 ( state : State ): value = interrupt ({ \"text_to_revise\" : state [ \"text_2\" ]}) return { \"text_2\" : value } graph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_node_1\" , human_node_1 ) graph_builder . add_node ( \"human_node_2\" , human_node_2 ) # Add both nodes in parallel from START graph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"human_node_1\" ) graph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"human_node_2\" ) checkpointer = InMemorySaver () graph = graph_builder . compile ( checkpointer = checkpointer ) thread_id = str ( uuid . uuid4 ()) config : RunnableConfig = { \"configurable\" : { \"thread_id\" : thread_id }} result = graph . invoke ( { \"text_1\" : \"original text 1\" , \"text_2\" : \"original text 2\" }, config = config ) # Resume with mapping of interrupt IDs to values resume_map = { i . id : f \"edited text for { i . value [ 'text_to_revise' ] } \" for i in graph . get_state ( config ) . interrupts } print ( graph . invoke ( Command ( resume = resume_map ), config = config )) # > {'text_1': 'edited text for original text 1', 'text_2': 'edited text for original text 2'} Common patterns Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using interrupt and Command. Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action.

This allows the agent to resume the same conversation on future invocations. config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"1\" } } for chunk in agent.stream( {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"book a stay at McKittrick hotel\"}]}, config ): print(chunk) print(\"\\n\") You should see that the agent runs until it reaches the interrupt() call, at which point it pauses and waits for human input. Resume the agent with a Command to continue based on human input. from langgraph.types import Command for chunk in agent . stream ( Command ( resume = { \"type\" : \"accept\" }), # Command(resume={\"type\": \"edit\", \"args\": {\"hotel_name\": \"McKittrick Hotel\"}}), config ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Add interrupts to any tool You can create a wrapper to add interrupts to any tool.

What is your age?\" answer = None continue else : # If the answer is valid, we can proceed. break print ( f \"The human in the loop is { answer } years old.\" ) return { \"age\" : answer } Debug with interrupts To debug and test a graph, use static interrupts (also known as static breakpoints) to step through the graph execution one node at a time or to pause the graph execution at specific nodes. Static interrupts are triggered at defined points either before or after a node executes. You can set static interrupts by specifying interrupt_before and interrupt_after at compile time or run time. Static interrupts are not recommended for human-in-the-loop workflows. Use dynamic interrupts instead. compile time graph = graph_builder.compile( interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"], interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"], checkpointer=checkpointer, ) config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\" } } # Run the graph until the breakpoint graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config) # Resume the graph graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config) Run time graph.invoke( inputs, interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"], interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"] config={ \"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"some_thread\"} }, ) config = { \"configurable\": { \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\" } } # Run the graph until the breakpoint graph.invoke(inputs, config=config) # Resume the graph graph.invoke(None, config=config) You cannot set static breakpoints at runtime for sub-graphs. If you have a sub-graph, you must set the breakpoints at compilation time. Use static interrupts in LangGraph Studio You can use LangGraph Studio to debug your graph. You can set static breakpoints in the UI and then run the graph. You can also use the UI to inspect the graph state at any point in the execution. LangGraph Studio is free with locally deployed applications using langgraph dev. Considerations When using human-in-the-loop, there are some considerations to keep in mind. Using with code with side-effects Place code with side effects, such as API calls, after the interrupt or in a separate node to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. Side effects after interrupt from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_node ( state : State ): \"\"\"Human node with validation.\"\"\" answer = interrupt ( question ) api_call ( answer ) # OK as it's after the interrupt Side effects in a separate node from langgraph.types import interrupt def human_node ( state : State ): \"\"\"Human node with validation.\"\"\" answer = interrupt ( question ) return { \"answer\" : answer } def api_call_node ( state : State ): api_call ( ... ) # OK as it's in a separate node Using with subgraphs called as functions When invoking a subgraph as a function, the parent graph will resume execution from the beginning of the node where the subgraph was invoked where the interrupt was triggered. Similarly, the subgraph will resume from the beginning of the node where the interrupt() function was called. def node_in_parent_graph ( state : State ) : some_code () # <-- This will re-execute when the subgraph is resumed. # Invoke a subgraph as a function. # The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call. subgraph_result = subgraph . invoke ( some_input ) ... Using multiple interrupts in a single node Using multiple interrupts within a single node can be helpful for patterns like validating human input. However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is strictly index-based, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical. To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via Command(resume=..., update=SOME_STATE_MUTATION) or relying on global variables to modify the node's structure dynamically.","title":"Enable human intervention"},{"location":"AgenticAI/LangGraph.html#time-travel","text":"When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail: \ud83e\udd14 Understand reasoning: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result. \ud83d\udc1e Debug mistakes: Identify where and why errors occurred. \ud83d\udd0d Explore alternatives: Test different paths to uncover better solutions. LangGraph provides time travel functionality to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint \u2014 either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history. Use time-travel To use time-travel in LangGraph: Run the graph with initial inputs using invoke or stream methods. Identify a checkpoint in an existing thread: Use the get_state_history() method to retrieve the execution history for a specific thread_id and locate the desired checkpoint_id. Alternatively, set an interrupt before the node(s) where you want execution to pause. You can then find the most recent checkpoint recorded up to that interrupt. **Update the graph state (optional): Use the update_state method to modify the graph's state at the checkpoint and resume execution from alternative state. Resume execution from the checkpoint: Use the invoke or stream methods with an input of None and a configuration containing the appropriate thread_id and checkpoint_id.

Subgraphs allow you to build complex systems with multiple components that are themselves graphs. Some reasons for using subgraphs are: building multi-agent systems when you want to reuse a set of nodes in multiple graphs when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph The main question when adding subgraphs is how the parent graph and subgraph communicate, i.e. how they pass the state between each other during the graph execution. There are two scenarios: parent and subgraph have shared state keys in their state schemas.

For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key. If your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph: Define the subgraph workflow ( subgraph_builder in the example below) and compile it Pass compiled subgraph to the .add_node method when defining the parent graph workflow from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : State ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( State ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) graph = builder . compile () Full example: shared state schemas from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START # Define subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): foo : str bar : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"bar\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo') return { \"foo\" : state [ \"foo\" ] + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : ParentState ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( ParentState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) graph = builder . compile () for chunk in graph . stream ({ \"foo\" : \"foo\" }): print ( chunk ) Different state schemas For more complex systems you might want to define subgraphs that have a completely different schema from the parent graph (no shared keys). For example, you might want to keep a private message history for each of the agents in a multi-agent system. If that's the case for your application, you need to define a node function that invokes the subgraph . This function needs to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node. from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): bar : str # Subgraph def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"bar\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Parent graph class State ( TypedDict ): foo : str def call_subgraph ( state : State ): subgraph_output = subgraph . invoke ({ \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ]}) return { \"foo\" : subgraph_output [ \"bar\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( State ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , call_subgraph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) graph = builder . compile () Full example: different state schemas from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START # Define subgraph class SubgraphState ( TypedDict ): # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state bar : str baz : str def subgraph_node_1 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"baz\" : \"baz\" } def subgraph_node_2 ( state : SubgraphState ): return { \"bar\" : state [ \"bar\" ] + state [ \"baz\" ]} subgraph_builder = StateGraph ( SubgraphState ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_1 ) subgraph_builder . add_node ( subgraph_node_2 ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( START , \"subgraph_node_1\" ) subgraph_builder . add_edge ( \"subgraph_node_1\" , \"subgraph_node_2\" ) subgraph = subgraph_builder . compile () # Define parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): foo : str def node_1 ( state : ParentState ): return { \"foo\" : \"hi! \" + state [ \"foo\" ]} def node_2 ( state : ParentState ): response = subgraph . invoke ({ \"bar\" : state [ \"foo\" ]}) return { \"foo\" : response [ \"bar\" ]} builder = StateGraph ( ParentState ) builder . add_node ( \"node_1\" , node_1 ) builder . add_node ( \"node_2\" , node_2 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"node_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"node_1\" , \"node_2\" ) graph = builder . compile () for chunk in graph . stream ({ \"foo\" : \"foo\" }, subgraphs = True ): print ( chunk ) Full example: different state schemas (two levels of subgraphs) # Grandchild graph from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph , START , END class GrandChildState ( TypedDict ): my_grandchild_key : str def grandchild_1 ( state : GrandChildState ) -> GrandChildState : # NOTE: child or parent keys will not be accessible here return { \"my_grandchild_key\" : state [ \"my_grandchild_key\" ] + \", how are you\" } grandchild = StateGraph ( GrandChildState ) grandchild . add_node ( \"grandchild_1\" , grandchild_1 ) grandchild . add_edge ( START , \"grandchild_1\" ) grandchild . add_edge ( \"grandchild_1\" , END ) grandchild_graph = grandchild . compile () # Child graph class ChildState ( TypedDict ): my_child_key : str def call_grandchild_graph ( state : ChildState ) -> ChildState : # NOTE: parent or grandchild keys won't be accessible here grandchild_graph_input = { \"my_grandchild_key\" : state [ \"my_child_key\" ]} grandchild_graph_output = grandchild_graph . invoke ( grandchild_graph_input ) return { \"my_child_key\" : grandchild_graph_output [ \"my_grandchild_key\" ] + \" today?\" } child = StateGraph ( ChildState ) child . add_node ( \"child_1\" , call_grandchild_graph ) child . add_edge ( START , \"child_1\" ) child . add_edge ( \"child_1\" , END ) child_graph = child . compile () # Parent graph class ParentState ( TypedDict ): my_key : str def parent_1 ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : # NOTE: child or grandchild keys won't be accessible here return { \"my_key\" : \"hi \" + state [ \"my_key\" ]} def parent_2 ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : return { \"my_key\" : state [ \"my_key\" ] + \" bye!\" } def call_child_graph ( state : ParentState ) -> ParentState : child_graph_input = { \"my_child_key\" : state [ \"my_key\" ]} child_graph_output = child_graph . invoke ( child_graph_input ) return { \"my_key\" : child_graph_output [ \"my_child_key\" ]} parent = StateGraph ( ParentState ) parent . add_node ( \"parent_1\" , parent_1 ) parent . add_node ( \"child\" , call_child_graph ) parent . add_node ( \"parent_2\" , parent_2 ) parent . add_edge ( START , \"parent_1\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"parent_1\" , \"child\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"child\" , \"parent_2\" ) parent . add_edge ( \"parent_2\" , END ) parent_graph = parent . compile () for chunk in parent_graph . stream ({ \"my_key\" : \"Bob\" }, subgraphs = True ): print ( chunk ) Add persistence You only need to provide the checkpointer when compiling the parent graph .

The primary benefits of using multi-agent systems are: Modularity: Separate agents make it easier to develop, test, and maintain agentic systems. Specialization: You can create expert agents focused on specific domains, which helps with the overall system performance. Control: You can explicitly control how agents communicate (as opposed to relying on function calling).","title":"Multi-agent systems"},{"location":"AgenticAI/LangGraph.html#multi-agent-architectures","text":"There are several ways to connect agents in a multi-agent system: Network: each agent can communicate with every other agent. Any agent can decide which other agent to call next. Supervisor: each agent communicates with a single supervisor agent. Supervisor agent makes decisions on which agent should be called next. Supervisor (tool-calling): this is a special case of supervisor architecture. Individual agents can be represented as tools. In this case, a supervisor agent uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which of the agent tools to call, as well as the arguments to pass to those agents. Hierarchical: you can define a multi-agent system with a supervisor of supervisors. This is a generalization of the supervisor architecture and allows for more complex control flows. Custom multi-agent workflow: each agent communicates with only a subset of agents. Parts of the flow are deterministic, and only some agents can decide which other agents to call next. Handoffs In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs , where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify: destination: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the node to go to) payload: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update) To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return Command object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates: def agent ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent\" , \"another_agent\" ]]: # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc. goto = get_next_agent ( ... ) # 'agent' / 'another_agent' return Command ( # Specify which agent to call next goto = goto , # Update the graph state update = { \"my_state_key\" : \"my_state_value\" } ) In a more complex scenario where each agent node is itself a graph (i.e., a subgraph), a node in one of the agent subgraphs might want to navigate to a different agent. For example, if you have two agents, alice and bob (subgraph nodes in a parent graph), and alice needs to navigate to bob, you can set graph=Command.PARENT in the Command object: def some_node_inside_alice(state): return Command( goto=\"bob\", update={\"my_state_key\": \"my_state_value\"}, # specify which graph to navigate to (defaults to the current graph) graph=Command.PARENT, ) If you need to support visualization for subgraphs communicating using Command(graph=Command.PARENT) you would need to wrap them in a node function with Command annotation: Instead of this: builder.add_node(alice) you would need to do this: def call_alice ( state ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"bob\" ]] : return alice . invoke ( state ) builder . add_node ( \"alice\" , call_alice ) Handoffs as tools One of the most common agent types is a tool-calling agent. For those types of agents, a common pattern is wrapping a handoff in a tool call: from langchain_core.tools import tool @tool def transfer_to_bob (): \"\"\"Transfer to bob.\"\"\" return Command ( # name of the agent (node) to go to goto = \"bob\" , # data to send to the agent update = { \"my_state_key\" : \"my_state_value\" }, # indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to # agent node in a parent graph graph = Command . PARENT , ) This is a special case of updating the graph state from tools where, in addition to the state update, the control flow is included as well. If you want to use tools that return Command, you can use the prebuilt create_react_agent / ToolNode components, or else implement your own logic: def call_tools ( state ): ... commands = [ tools_by_name [ tool_call [ \"name\" ]] . invoke ( tool_call ) for tool_call in tool_calls ] return commands Network In this architecture, agents are defined as graph nodes. Each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. This architecture is good for problems that do not have a clear hierarchy of agents or a specific sequence in which agents should be called. from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.types import Command from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END model = ChatOpenAI () def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_2\" , \"agent_3\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_agent\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the agents or exit based on the LLM's decision # if the LLM returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_3\" , END ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) def agent_3 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" , END ]]: ... return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ], update = { \"messages\" : [ response [ \"content\" ]]}, ) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) builder . add_node ( agent_3 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"agent_1\" ) network = builder . compile () Supervisor In this architecture, we define agents as nodes and add a supervisor node (LLM) that decides which agent nodes should be called next. We use Command to route execution to the appropriate agent node based on supervisor's decision. This architecture also lends itself well to running multiple agents in parallel or using map-reduce pattern . from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.types import Command from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END model = ChatOpenAI () def supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_agent\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the agents or exit based on the supervisor's decision # if the supervisor returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ]) def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"supervisor\" ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.) response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}, ) def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}, ) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( supervisor ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"supervisor\" ) supervisor = builder . compile () Supervisor (tool-calling) In this variant of the supervisor architecture, we define a supervisor agent which is responsible for calling sub-agents. The sub-agents are exposed to the supervisor as tools, and the supervisor agent decides which tool to call next. The supervisor agent follows a standard implementation as an LLM running in a while loop calling tools until it decides to stop. from typing import Annotated from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState , create_react_agent model = ChatOpenAI () # this is the agent function that will be called as tool # notice that you can pass the state to the tool via InjectedState annotation def agent_1 ( state : Annotated [ dict , InjectedState ]): # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # return the LLM response as a string (expected tool response format) # this will be automatically turned to ToolMessage # by the prebuilt create_react_agent (supervisor) return response . content def agent_2 ( state : Annotated [ dict , InjectedState ]): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return response . content tools = [ agent_1 , agent_2 ] # the simplest way to build a supervisor w/ tool-calling is to use prebuilt ReAct agent graph # that consists of a tool-calling LLM node (i.e. supervisor) and a tool-executing node supervisor = create_react_agent ( model , tools ) Hierarchical As you add more agents to your system, it might become too hard for the supervisor to manage all of them. The supervisor might start making poor decisions about which agent to call next, or the context might become too complex for a single supervisor to keep track of. In other words, you end up with the same problems that motivated the multi-agent architecture in the first place. To address this, you can design your system hierarchically. For example, you can create separate, specialized teams of agents managed by individual supervisors, and a top-level supervisor to manage the teams. from typing import Literal from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START , END from langgraph.types import Command model = ChatOpenAI () # define team 1 (same as the single supervisor example above) def team_1_supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_agent_1\" , \"team_1_agent_2\" , END ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_agent\" ]) def team_1_agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"team_1_supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}) def team_1_agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_supervisor\" ]]: response = model . invoke ( ... ) return Command ( goto = \"team_1_supervisor\" , update = { \"messages\" : [ response ]}) team_1_builder = StateGraph ( Team1State ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_supervisor ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_agent_1 ) team_1_builder . add_node ( team_1_agent_2 ) team_1_builder . add_edge ( START , \"team_1_supervisor\" ) team_1_graph = team_1_builder . compile () # define team 2 (same as the single supervisor example above) class Team2State ( MessagesState ): next : Literal [ \"team_2_agent_1\" , \"team_2_agent_2\" , \"__end__\" ] def team_2_supervisor ( state : Team2State ): ... def team_2_agent_1 ( state : Team2State ): ... def team_2_agent_2 ( state : Team2State ): ... team_2_builder = StateGraph ( Team2State ) ... team_2_graph = team_2_builder . compile () # define top-level supervisor builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) def top_level_supervisor ( state : MessagesState ) -> Command [ Literal [ \"team_1_graph\" , \"team_2_graph\" , END ]]: # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state[\"messages\"]) # to determine which team to call next. a common pattern is to call the model # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a \"next_team\" field) response = model . invoke ( ... ) # route to one of the teams or exit based on the supervisor's decision # if the supervisor returns \"__end__\", the graph will finish execution return Command ( goto = response [ \"next_team\" ]) builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( top_level_supervisor ) builder . add_node ( \"team_1_graph\" , team_1_graph ) builder . add_node ( \"team_2_graph\" , team_2_graph ) builder . add_edge ( START , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"team_1_graph\" , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"team_2_graph\" , \"top_level_supervisor\" ) graph = builder . compile () Custom multi-agent workflow In this architecture we add individual agents as graph nodes and define the order in which agents are called ahead of time, in a custom workflow. In LangGraph the workflow can be defined in two ways: Explicit control flow (normal edges): LangGraph allows you to explicitly define the control flow of your application (i.e. the sequence of how agents communicate) explicitly, via normal graph edges. This is the most deterministic variant of this architecture above \u2014 we always know which agent will be called next ahead of time. Dynamic control flow (Command): in LangGraph you can allow LLMs to decide parts of your application control flow. This can be achieved by using Command. A special case of this is a supervisor tool-calling architecture. In that case, the tool-calling LLM powering the supervisor agent will make decisions about the order in which the tools (agents) are being called. from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState , START model = ChatOpenAI () def agent_1 ( state : MessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} def agent_2 ( state : MessagesState ): response = model . invoke ( ... ) return { \"messages\" : [ response ]} builder = StateGraph ( MessagesState ) builder . add_node ( agent_1 ) builder . add_node ( agent_2 ) # define the flow explicitly builder . add_edge ( START , \"agent_1\" ) builder . add_edge ( \"agent_1\" , \"agent_2\" ) Communication and state management The most important thing when building multi-agent systems is figuring out how the agents communicate. Handoffs vs tool calls What is the \"payload\" that is being passed around between agents? In most of the architectures discussed above, the agents communicate via handoffs and pass the graph state as part of the handoff payload. Specifically, agents pass around lists of messages as part of the graph state. In the case of the supervisor with tool-calling, the payloads are tool call arguments. Message passing between agents The most common way for agents to communicate is via a shared state channel, typically a list of messages. This assumes that there is always at least a single channel (key) in the state that is shared by the agents (e.g., messages). When communicating via a shared message list, there is an additional consideration: should the agents share the full history of their thought process or only the final result? Sharing full thought process Agents can share the full history of their thought process (i.e., \"scratchpad\") with all other agents. This \"scratchpad\" would typically look like a list of messages. The benefit of sharing the full thought process is that it might help other agents make better decisions and improve reasoning ability for the system as a whole. The downside is that as the number of agents and their complexity grows, the \"scratchpad\" will grow quickly and might require additional strategies for memory management. Sharing only final results Agents can have their own private \"scratchpad\" and only share the final result with the rest of the agents. This approach might work better for systems with many agents or agents that are more complex. In this case, you would need to define agents with different state schemas. For agents called as tools, the supervisor determines the inputs based on the tool schema. Additionally, LangGraph allows passing state to individual tools at runtime, so subordinate agents can access parent state, if needed. Indicating agent name in messages It can be helpful to indicate which agent a particular AI message is from, especially for long message histories. Some LLM providers (like OpenAI) support adding a name parameter to messages \u2014 you can use that to attach the agent name to the message. If that is not supported, you can consider manually injecting the agent name into the message content, e.g., alice message from alice .","title":"Multi-agent architectures"},{"location":"AgenticAI/LangGraph.html#multi-agent","text":"A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and compose them into a multi-agent system. In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via handoffs \u2014 a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent. Two of the most popular multi-agent architectures are: supervisor \u2014 individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements. swarm \u2014 agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent. Use langgraph-supervisor library to create a supervisor multi-agent system: pip install langgraph-supervisor from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor def book_hotel ( hotel_name : str ): \"\"\"Book a hotel\"\"\" return f \"Successfully booked a stay at { hotel_name } .\" def book_flight ( from_airport : str , to_airport : str ): \"\"\"Book a flight\"\"\" return f \"Successfully booked a flight from { from_airport } to { to_airport } .\" flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"openai:gpt-4o\" , tools = [ book_flight ], prompt = \"You are a flight booking assistant\" , name = \"flight_assistant\" ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"openai:gpt-4o\" , tools = [ book_hotel ], prompt = \"You are a hotel booking assistant\" , name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) supervisor = create_supervisor ( agents = [ flight_assistant , hotel_assistant ], model = ChatOpenAI ( model = \"gpt-4o\" ), prompt = ( \"You manage a hotel booking assistant and a\" \"flight booking assistant. Assign work to them.\" ) ) . compile () for chunk in supervisor . stream ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel\" } ] } ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Use langgraph-swarm library to create a swarm multi-agent system: pip install langgraph-swarm from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent from langgraph_swarm import create_swarm , create_handoff_tool transfer_to_hotel_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"hotel_assistant\" , description = \"Transfer user to the hotel-booking assistant.\" , ) transfer_to_flight_assistant = create_handoff_tool ( agent_name = \"flight_assistant\" , description = \"Transfer user to the flight-booking assistant.\" , ) flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ book_flight , transfer_to_hotel_assistant ], prompt = \"You are a flight booking assistant\" , name = \"flight_assistant\" ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( model = \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\" , tools = [ book_hotel , transfer_to_flight_assistant ], prompt = \"You are a hotel booking assistant\" , name = \"hotel_assistant\" ) swarm = create_swarm ( agents = [ flight_assistant , hotel_assistant ], default_active_agent = \"flight_assistant\" ) . compile () for chunk in swarm . stream ( { \"messages\" : [ { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel\" } ] } ): print ( chunk ) print ( \" \\n \" ) Handoffs A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify: destination: target agent to navigate to payload: information to pass to that agent This is used both by langgraph-supervisor (supervisor hands off to individual agents) and langgraph-swarm (an individual agent can hand off to other agents). To implement handoffs with create_react_agent , you need to: Create a special tool that can transfer control to a different agent def transfer_to_bob () : \"\"\"Transfer to bob.\"\"\" return Command ( # name of the agent ( node ) to go to goto = \"bob\" , # data to send to the agent update = { \"messages\" : [ ... ] } , # indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to # agent node in a parent graph graph = Command . PARENT , ) Create individual agents that have access to handoff tools: flight_assistant = create_react_agent ( ... , tools = [ book_flight , transfer_to_hotel_assistant ] ) hotel_assistant = create_react_agent ( ... , tools = [ book_hotel , transfer_to_flight_assistant ] ) Define a parent graph that contains individual agents as nodes: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , MessagesState multi_agent_graph = ( StateGraph ( MessagesState ) . add_node ( flight_assistant ) . add_node ( hotel_assistant ) ... ) Putting this together, here is how you can implement a simple multi-agent system with two agents \u2014 a flight booking assistant and a hotel booking assistant: from typing import Annotated from langchain_core.tools import tool , InjectedToolCallId from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent , InjectedState from langgraph.graph import StateGraph , START , MessagesState from langgraph.types import Command def create_handoff_tool ( * , agent_name : str , description : str | None = None ): name = f \"transfer_to_ { agent_name } \" description = description or f \"Transfer to { agent_name } \" @tool ( name , description = description ) def handoff_tool ( state : Annotated [ MessagesState , InjectedState ], tool_call_id : Annotated [ str , InjectedToolCallId ], ) -> Command : tool_message = { \"role\" : \"tool\" , \"content\" : f \"Successfully transferred to { agent_name } \" , \"name\" : name , \"tool_call_id\" : tool_call_id , } return Command ( goto = agent_name , update = { \"messages\" : state [ \"messages\" ] + [ tool_message ]}, graph = Command .

You would need to first define an evaluator function to judge the results from an agent, such as final outputs or trajectory. Depending on your evaluation technique, this may or may not involve a reference output: def evaluator(*, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict): # compare agent outputs against reference outputs output_messages = outputs[\"messages\"] reference_messages = reference_outputs[\"messages\"] score = compare_messages(output_messages, reference_messages) return {\"key\": \"evaluator_score\", \"score\": score} To get started, you can use prebuilt evaluators from AgentEvals package: pip install -U agentevals Create evaluator A common way to evaluate agent performance is by comparing its trajectory (the order in which it calls its tools) against a reference trajectory: import json from agentevals.trajectory.match import create_trajectory_match_evaluator outputs = [ { \"role\" : \"assistant\" , \"tool_calls\" : [ { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"city\" : \"san francisco\" }), } }, { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_directions\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"destination\" : \"presidio\" }), } } ], } ] reference_outputs = [ { \"role\" : \"assistant\" , \"tool_calls\" : [ { \"function\" : { \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"arguments\" : json . dumps ({ \"city\" : \"san francisco\" }), } }, ], } ] # Create the evaluator evaluator = create_trajectory_match_evaluator ( trajectory_match_mode = \"superset\" , ) # Run the evaluator result = evaluator ( outputs = outputs , reference_outputs = reference_outputs ) LLM-as-a-judge You can use LLM-as-a-judge evaluator that uses an LLM to compare the trajectory against the reference outputs and output a score: import json from agentevals.trajectory.llm import ( create_trajectory_llm_as_judge , TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE ) evaluator = create_trajectory_llm_as_judge ( prompt = TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE , model = \"openai:o3-mini\" ) Run evaluator To run an evaluator, you will first need to create a LangSmith dataset. To use the prebuilt AgentEvals evaluators, you will need a dataset with the following schema: input : {\"messages\": [...]} input messages to call the agent with. output : {\"messages\": [...]} expected message history in the agent output.

Installation # Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. CrewAI uses UV for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience. First, install CrewAI: pip install crewai If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command: pip install 'crewai[tools]' Common Issues # ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken' Install tiktoken explicitly: pip install 'crewai[embeddings]' -If using embedchain or other tools: pip install 'crewai[tools]' Failed building wheel for tiktoken Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above) For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed Try upgrading pip: pip install --upgrade pip If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration # To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command: crewai create crew <project_name> This command creates a new project folder with the following structure: my_project / \u251c\u2500\u2500 . gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 pyproject . toml \u251c\u2500\u2500 README . md \u251c\u2500\u2500 . env \u2514\u2500\u2500 src / \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_project / \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__ . py \u251c\u2500\u2500 main . py \u251c\u2500\u2500 crew . py \u251c\u2500\u2500 tools / \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom_tool . py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__ . py \u2514\u2500\u2500 config / \u251c\u2500\u2500 agents . yaml \u2514\u2500\u2500 tasks . yaml You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the src/my_project folder. Entry point of the project, the crew.py file is where you define your crew. The agents.yaml file is where you define your agents The tasks.yaml file is where you define your tasks. To customize your project, you can: - Modify src/my_project/config/agents.yaml to define your agents. - Modify src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml to define your tasks. - Modify src/my_project/crew.py to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments. - Modify src/my_project/main.py to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks. - Add your environment variables into the .env file. Example of a simple crew with a sequential process: # Instantiate your crew: crewai create crew latest-ai-development Modify the files as needed to fit your use case: agents.yaml # src/my_project/config/agents.yaml researcher: role: > {topic} Senior Data Researcher goal: > Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic} backstory: > You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest developments in {topic}.

Understanding the Decision Framework # When building AI applications with CrewAI, one of the most important decisions you\u2019ll make is choosing the right approach for your specific use case.Should you use a Crew? A Flow? A combination of both? This guide will help you evaluate your requirements and make informed architectural decisions. At the heart of this decision is understanding the relationship between complexity and precision in your application: This matrix helps visualize how different approaches align with varying requirements for complexity and precision. Let\u2019s explore what each quadrant means and how it guides your architectural choices. The Complexity-Precision Matrix Explained # What is Complexity? In the context of CrewAI applications, complexity refers to: The number of distinct steps or operations required The diversity of tasks that need to be performed The interdependencies between different components The need for conditional logic and branching The sophistication of the overall workflow What is Precision? # Precision in this context refers to: The accuracy required in the final output The need for structured, predictable results The importance of reproducibility The level of control needed over each step The tolerance for variation in outputs The Four Quadrants # Low Complexity, Low Precision Characteristics: Simple, straightforward tasks Tolerance for some variation in outputs Limited number of steps Creative or exploratory applications Recommended Approach: Simple Crews with minimal agents Example Use Cases: - Basic content generation - Idea brainstorming - Simple summarization tasks - Creative writing assistance 2. Low Complexity, High Precision # Characteristics: - Simple workflows that require exact, structured outputs - Need for reproducible results - Limited steps but high accuracy requirements - Often involves data processing or transformation Example Use Cases: Data extraction and transformation Form filling and validation Structured content generation (JSON, XML) Simple classification tasks 3. High Complexity, Low Precision # Characteristics: Multi-stage processes with many steps Creative or exploratory outputs Complex interactions between components Tolerance for variation in final results Recommended Approach: Complex Crews with multiple specialized agents Example Use Cases: Research and analysis Content creation pipelines Exploratory data analysis Creative problem-solving 4. High Complexity, High Precision # Characteristics: Complex workflows requiring structured outputs Multiple interdependent steps with strict accuracy requirements Need for both sophisticated processing and precise results Often mission-critical applications Recommended Approach: Flows orchestrating multiple Crews with validation steps Example Use Cases: Enterprise decision support systems Complex data processing pipelines Multi-stage document processing Regulated industry applications Choosing Between Crews and Flows # When to Choose Crews Crews are ideal when: You need collaborative intelligence - Multiple agents with different specializations need to work together The problem requires emergent thinking - The solution benefits from different perspectives and approaches The task is primarily creative or analytical - The work involves research, content creation, or analysis You value adaptability over strict structure - The workflow can benefit from agent autonomy The output format can be somewhat flexible - Some variation in output structure is acceptable Example: Research Crew for market analysis # from crewai import Agent , Crew , Process , Task # Create specialized agents researcher = Agent ( role = \"Market Research Specialist\" , goal = \"Find comprehensive market data on emerging technologies\" , backstory = \"You are an expert at discovering market trends and gathering data.\" ) analyst = Agent ( role = \"Market Analyst\" , goal = \"Analyze market data and identify key opportunities\" , backstory = \"You excel at interpreting market data and spotting valuable insights.\" ) # Define their tasks research_task = Task ( description = \"Research the current market landscape for AI-powered healthcare solutions\" , expected_output = \"Comprehensive market data including key players, market size, and growth trends\" , agent = researcher ) analysis_task = Task ( description = \"Analyze the market data and identify the top 3 investment opportunities\" , expected_output = \"Analysis report with 3 recommended investment opportunities and rationale\" , agent = analyst , context = [ research_task ] ) # Create the crew market_analysis_crew = Crew ( agents = [ researcher , analyst ], tasks = [ research_task , analysis_task ], process = Process . sequential , verbose = True ) # Run the crew result = market_analysis_crew . kickoff () When to Choose Flows # Flows are ideal when: You need precise control over execution - The workflow requires exact sequencing and state management The application has complex state requirements - You need to maintain and transform state across multiple steps You need structured, predictable outputs - The application requires consistent, formatted results The workflow involves conditional logic - Different paths need to be taken based on intermediate results You need to combine AI with procedural code -

The Art and Science of Agent Design # At the heart of CrewAI lies the agent - a specialized AI entity designed to perform specific roles within a collaborative framework. While creating basic agents is simple, crafting truly effective agents that produce exceptional results requires understanding key design principles and best practices. This guide will help you master the art of agent design, enabling you to create specialized AI personas that collaborate effectively, think critically, and produce high-quality outputs tailored to your specific needs. Why Agent Design Matters? # The way you define your agents significantly impacts: Output quality : Well-designed agents produce more relevant, high-quality results Collaboration effectiveness : Agents with complementary skills work together more efficiently Task performance : Agents with clear roles and goals execute tasks more effectively System scalability : Thoughtfully designed agents can be reused across multiple crews and contexts Let\u2019s explore best practices for creating agents that excel in these dimensions. # The 80/20 Rule: Focus on Tasks Over Agents # When building effective AI systems, remember this crucial principle: 80% of your effort should go into designing tasks, and only 20% into defining agents . Why? Because even the most perfectly defined agent will fail with poorly designed tasks, but well-designed tasks can elevate even a simple agent. This means: Spend most of your time writing clear task instructions Define detailed inputs and expected outputs Add examples and context to guide execution Dedicate the remaining time to agent role, goal, and backstory This doesn\u2019t mean agent design isn\u2019t important - it absolutely is. But task design is where most execution failures occur, so prioritize accordingly. Core Principles of Effective Agent Design # 1. The Role-Goal-Backstory Framework The most powerful agents in CrewAI are built on a strong foundation of three key elements: Role: The Agent\u2019s Specialized Function The role defines what the agent does and their area of expertise. When crafting roles: Be specific and specialized : Instead of \u201cWriter,\u201d use \u201cTechnical Documentation Specialist\u201d or \u201cCreative Storyteller\u201d Align with real-world professions : Base roles on recognizable professional archetypes Include domain expertise : Specify the agent\u2019s field of knowledge (e.g., \u201cFinancial Analyst specializing in market trends\u201d) Examples of effective roles: role: \"Senior UX Researcher specializing in user interview analysis\" role: \"Full-Stack Software Architect with expertise in distributed systems\" role: \"Corporate Communications Director specializing in crisis management\" Goal: The Agent\u2019s Purpose and Motivation # The goal directs the agent\u2019s efforts and shapes their decision-making process. Effective goals should: Be clear and outcome-focused : Define what the agent is trying to achieve Emphasize quality standards : Include expectations about the quality of work Incorporate success criteria : Help the agent understand what \u201cgood\u201d looks like Examples of effective goals: goal : \"Uncover actionable user insights by analyzing interview data and identifying recurring patterns, unmet needs, and improvement opportunities\" goal : \"Design robust, scalable system architectures that balance performance, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness\" goal : \"Craft clear, empathetic crisis communications that address stakeholder concerns while protecting organizational reputation\" Backstory: The Agent\u2019s Experience and Perspective # The backstory gives depth to the agent, influencing how they approach problems and interact with others. Good backstories: Establish expertise and experience : Explain how the agent gained their skills Define working style and values : Describe how the agent approaches their work Create a cohesive persona : Ensure all elements of the backstory align with the role and goal Examples of effective backstories: backstory : \"You have spent 15 years conducting and analyzing user research for top tech companies. You have a talent for reading between the lines and identifying patterns that others miss. You believe that good UX is invisible and that the best insights come from listening to what users don't say as much as what they do say.\" backstory : \"With 20+ years of experience building distributed systems at scale, you've developed a pragmatic approach to software architecture. You've seen both successful and failed systems and have learned valuable lessons from each. You balance theoretical best practices with practical constraints and always consider the maintenance and operational aspects of your designs.\" backstory : \"As a seasoned communications professional who has guided multiple organizations through high-profile crises, you understand the importance of transparency, speed, and empathy in crisis response. You have a methodical approach to crafting messages that address concerns while maintaining organizational credibility.\" 2. Specialists Over Generalists # Agents perform significantly better when given specialized roles rather than general ones. A highly focused agent delivers more precise, relevant outputs: Generic (Less Effective): role: \"Writer\" Specialized (More Effective): role: \"Technical Blog Writer specializing in explaining complex AI concepts to non-technical audiences\" Specialist Benefits: Clearer understanding of expected output More consistent performance Better alignment with specific tasks Improved ability to make domain-specific judgments 3. Balancing Specialization and Versatility # Effective agents strike the right balance between specialization (doing one thing extremely well) and versatility (being adaptable to various situations): Specialize in role, versatile in application : Create agents with specialized skills that can be applied across multiple contexts Avoid overly narrow definitions : Ensure agents can handle variations within their domain of expertise Consider the collaborative context : Design agents whose specializations complement the other agents they\u2019ll work with 4. Setting Appropriate Expertise Levels # The expertise level you assign to your agent shapes how they approach tasks: Novice agents : Good for straightforward tasks, brainstorming, or initial drafts Intermediate agents : Suitable for most standard tasks with reliable execution Expert agents: Best for complex, specialized tasks requiring depth and nuance World-class agents : Reserved for critical tasks where exceptional quality is needed Choose the appropriate expertise level based on task complexity and quality requirements. For most collaborative crews, a mix of expertise levels often works best, with higher expertise assigned to core specialized functions. Practical Examples: Before and After # Let\u2019s look at some examples of agent definitions before and after applying these best practices: Example 1: Content Creation Agent # Before: role: \"Writer\" goal: \"Write good content\" backstory: \"You are a writer who creates content for websites.\" After: role: \"B2B Technology Content Strategist\" goal: \"Create compelling, technically accurate content that explains complex topics in accessible language while driving reader engagement and supporting business objectives\" backstory: \"You have spent a decade creating content for leading technology companies, specializing in translating technical concepts for business audiences. You excel at research, interviewing subject matter experts, and structuring information for maximum clarity and impact. You believe that the best B2B content educates first and sells second, building trust through genuine expertise rather than marketing hype.\" Example 2: Research Agent # Before: role: \"Researcher\" goal: \"Find information\" backstory: \"You are good at finding information online.\" After: role : \"Academic Research Specialist in Emerging Technologies\" goal : \"Discover and synthesize cutting-edge research, identifying key trends, methodologies, and findings while evaluating the quality and reliability of sources\" backstory : \"With a background in both computer science and library science, you've mastered the art of digital research. You've worked with research teams at prestigious universities and know how to navigate academic databases, evaluate research quality, and synthesize findings across disciplines. You're methodical in your approach, always cross-referencing information and tracing claims to primary sources before drawing conclusions.\" Crafting Effective Tasks for Your Agents # While agent design is important, task design is critical for successful execution. Here are best practices for designing tasks that set your agents up for success: The Anatomy of an Effective Task # A well-designed task has two key components that serve different purposes: Task Description: The Process # The description should focus on what to do and how to do it, including: Detailed instructions for execution Context and background information Scope and constraints Process steps to follow Expected Output: The Deliverable # The expected output should define what the final result should look like: Format specifications (markdown, JSON, etc.) Structure requirements Quality criteria Examples of good outputs (when possible) Task Design Best Practices # 1. Single Purpose, Single Output # Tasks perform best when focused on one clear objective: Bad Example (Too Broad): # task_description: \"Research market trends, analyze the data, and create a visualization.\" Good Example (Focused): # # Task 1 research_task: description: \"Research the top 5 market trends in the AI industry for 2024.\" expected_output: \"A markdown list of the 5 trends with supporting evidence.\" # Task 2 analysis_task: description: \"Analyze the identified trends to determine potential business impacts.\" expected_output: \"A structured analysis with impact ratings (High/Medium/Low).\" # Task 3 visualization_task: description: \"Create a visual representation of the analyzed trends.\" expected_output: \"A description of a chart showing trends and their impact ratings.\" 2. Be Explicit About Inputs and Outputs # Always clearly specify what inputs the task will use and what the output should look like: Example: analysis_task : description : > Analyze the customer feedback data from the CSV file . Focus on identifying recurring themes related to product usability . Consider sentiment and frequency when determining importance . expected_output : > A markdown report with the following sections : 1 . Executive summary ( 3 - 5 bullet points ) 2 . Top 3 usability issues with supporting data 3 . Recommendations for improvement 3. Include Purpose and Context # Explain why the task matters and how it fits into the larger workflow: Example: competitor_analysis_task : description : > Analyze our three main competitors ' pricing strategies . This analysis will inform our upcoming pricing model revision . Focus on identifying patterns in how they price premium features and how they structure their tiered offerings . 4. Use Structured Output Tools # For machine-readable outputs, specify the format clearly: Example: data_extraction_task : description : \"Extract key metrics from the quarterly report.\" expected_output : \"JSON object with the following keys: revenue, growth_rate, customer_acquisition_cost, and retention_rate.\" Common Mistakes to Avoid # Based on lessons learned from real-world implementations, here are the most common pitfalls in agent and task design: 1. Unclear Task Instructions # Problem: Tasks lack sufficient detail, making it difficult for agents to execute effectively. Example of Poor Design: research_task : description : \"Research AI trends.\" expected_output : \"A report on AI trends.\"","title":"crewai"},{"location":"AgenticAI/crewai.html#what-is-crewai","text":"CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch\u2014completely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks.","title":"What is CrewAI?"},{"location":"AgenticAI/crewai.html#core-components-of-a-crew-flow","text":"Component Description Agents Individual LLM-powered workers with a role, goal, and behavior (e.g., Researcher, Analyst, Developer) Tasks Discrete units of work assigned to agents (e.g., \"Summarize a report\", \"Extract financial KPIs\") Crew A team of agents orchestrated to execute a full task plan Crew Flow The execution pipeline that controls how the agents collaborate to complete the full workflow","title":"\u2705 Core Components of a Crew Flow"},{"location":"AgenticAI/crewai.html#why-crewai","text":"CrewAI unlocks the true potential of multi-agent automation, delivering the best-in-class combination of speed, flexibility, and control with either Crews of AI Agents or Flows of Events: Standalone Framework: Built from scratch, independent of LangChain or any other agent framework.

It's a step beyond traditional AI and generative AI, enabling AI agents to go beyond content creation and perform complex tasks by integrating with various systems and tools. What is Agentic AI? # At its core, Agentic AI is a type of AI that\u2019s all about autonomy. This means that it can make decisions, take actions, and even learn on its own to achieve specific goals. It\u2019s kind of like having a virtual assistant that can think, reason, and adapt to changing circumstances without needing constant direction. Agentic AI operates in four key stages: Perception: It gathers data from the world around it. Reasoning: It processes this data to understand what\u2019s going on. Action: It decides what to do based on its understanding. Learning: It improves and adapts over time, learning from feedback and experience. Autonomous Agents: Agentic AI systems utilize AI agents \u2013 individual software entities that perform specific tasks with a degree of autonomy. Goal-Oriented: These agents are designed to understand user goals and autonomously take actions to achieve them, rather than just responding to specific instructions. Adaptive and Learning: Agentic AI systems are adaptive and can learn from interactions, refining their strategies and improving performance over time. Beyond Generative AI: While generative AI focuses on creating content, agentic AI extends this capability by using generated content to complete tasks, integrate with other systems, and achieve broader goals. How Agentic AI Will Change Work: # Increased Automation: Agentic AI can automate complex, multi-step workflows and business processes that were previously difficult or impossible to automate with traditional systems. Improved Productivity: By taking over routine and repetitive tasks, agentic AI can free up human workers to focus on more strategic, creative, and high-value work. Enhanced Collaboration: Agentic AI can facilitate seamless collaboration between humans and AI, with AI acting as a partner, assistant, or even a coach. Data-Driven Decisions: Agentic AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights that can help organizations make more informed decisions. What is an AI Agent? # On the other hand, AI Agents are typically built to do specific tasks. They\u2019re designed to help you with something \u2014 like answering questions, organizing your calendar, or even managing your email inbox. AI Agents are great at automating simple, repetitive tasks but don\u2019t have the autonomy or decision-making abilities that Agentic AI does. Think of them as virtual helpers that do exactly what you tell them to do, without thinking for themselves. What\u2019s the Difference? # Aspect Agentic AI AI Agent Autonomy Level Highly autonomous, can act independently Limited autonomy, needs human input Goal-Orientation Goal-driven, solves problems on its own Task-specific, follows set instructions Learning Capabilities Continuously learns and improves May not learn or only learns within set rules Complexity Handles complex, dynamic environments Handles simpler, more structured tasks Decision-Making Process Makes decisions based on reasoning and analysis Pre-programmed responses to inputs Interaction with Environment Actively adapts to surroundings and changes Reacts to set inputs but doesn\u2019t adapt Responsiveness to Change Changes its goals and methods autonomously Limited ability to adapt to new situations Where Do We See These in the Real World? # Both Agentic AI and AI Agents have started popping up in various industries, and their applications are growing fast. Agentic AI in Action # Self-Driving Cars: One of the most exciting uses of Agentic AI is in autonomous vehicles. These AI systems perceive their surroundings, make driving decisions, and learn from every trip. Over time, they get better at navigating and handling new challenges on the road. For example, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving system is an example of Agentic AI that continuously learns from the driving environment and adjusts its behavior to improve safety and efficiency. Supply Chain Management: Agentic AI is also helping companies optimize their supply chains. By autonomously managing inventory, predicting demand, and adjusting delivery routes in real-time, AI can ensure smoother, more efficient operations. Amazon\u2019s Warehouse Robots, powered by AI, are an example \u2014 these robots navigate complex environments, adapt to different conditions, and autonomously move goods around warehouses. Cybersecurity: In the world of cybersecurity, Agentic AI can detect threats and vulnerabilities by analyzing network activity and automatically responding to potential breaches. Darktrace, an AI cybersecurity company, uses Agentic AI to autonomously detect, respond to, and learn from potential cyber threats in real-time. Healthcare: AI is playing a big role in healthcare, too. Agentic AI can assist with diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care management. It analyzes medical data, identifies patterns, and helps doctors make more informed decisions. For instance, IBM\u2019s Watson Health uses AI to analyze massive amounts of healthcare data, learning from new information to offer insights that help doctors and healthcare professionals. AI Agents in Action # Customer Support: One of the most common uses of AI Agents is in customer service. Chatbots can answer questions, resolve issues, and guide customers through processes \u2014 all without needing human intervention. Zendesk\u2019s AI-powered chatbot helps businesses respond to customer queries quickly and efficiently, acting as an AI Agent that handles common issues and frees up human agents for more complex tasks. Personal Assistants: You probably already interact with an AI Agent every day if you use voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant. They can help you set reminders, check the weather, or play your favorite music \u2014 tasks that are useful but don\u2019t require much decision-making. These AI Agents rely on predefined commands and are great at handling simple, repetitive tasks. Email Management: AI Agents are also great for managing your inbox. They can sort emails, flag important ones, and even provide smart replies to save you time. Google\u2019s Gmail Smart Compose feature is an excellent example of an AI Agent at work, helping users respond to emails faster by suggesting phrases based on context. Productivity Tools: Tools like GitHub Copilot are AI Agents that help software developers by suggesting code and helping with debugging. They\u2019re like having a second set of eyes that\u2019s always there to help. By offering code suggestions in real-time, this AI Agent enhances developer productivity, allowing them to focus on more creative aspects of their work.","title":"general"},{"location":"AgenticAI/general.html#what-is-agentic-ai-and-how-will-it-change-work","text":"Agentic AI refers to AI systems capable of autonomous action and decision-making to achieve specific goals, often with minimal human supervision.

The field of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving beyond reactive models to embrace a new paradigm: Agentic AI. This transformative approach empowers AI systems to act autonomously, make decisions, and proactively work towards goals with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to specific commands, agentic AI systems are dynamic problem-solvers, capable of planning, executing multi-step tasks, and adapting to changing environments. At its core, an agentic AI system, or an \"AI agent,\" is a software entity that perceives its environment, reasons about its observations, and takes actions to achieve a specific objective. This process involves a sophisticated interplay of several key components: Perception: The agent gathers information from its digital or physical environment through various inputs like data feeds, APIs, or sensor readings. Reasoning and Planning: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and other advanced algorithms, the agent analyzes the perceived information, breaks down complex goals into smaller, manageable steps, and formulates a plan of action. Action: The agent executes its plan by interacting with its environment. This could involve anything from sending an email and updating a database to controlling a robotic arm. Learning and Adaptation: Through feedback loops and experience, the agent continuously learns and refines its strategies to improve its performance over time. This adaptability is a hallmark of agentic AI. Orchestration: In more complex scenarios, multiple AI agents can be orchestrated to work together, each with specialized skills, to tackle multifaceted problems. \ud83d\udccc Types of Agents in AI: There are several types of agents in AI , each differing in how they perceive the environment, process information, and take actions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are the foundation of many intelligent systems which helps them to understand their environment, make decisions and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents vary in complexity from simple reflex-based systems to advanced models that learn and adapt over time. 1. Simple Reflex Agents: A Simple Reflex Agent is the most basic type of intelligent agent in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It works on the principle of condition\u2013action rules (also called if\u2013then rules ). That means it looks at the current percept (the environment input it senses) and chooses an action without considering history or future consequences . Note: Simple Reflex Agents (SRA) are not typically implemented with frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, or AutoGen . Simple Reflex Agent = Based only on if\u2013then rules (condition \u2192 action). It does not require memory, reasoning, planning, or multi-agent collaboration. Frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, AutoGen are designed for complex, reasoning-based, multi-agent workflows with LLMs \u2014 which is much more than a reflex agent needs . \u2705 Suitable Frameworks for Simple Reflex Agent If you want to implement a Simple Reflex Agent , you\u2019d use: Finite State Machines (FSMs) Rule-based systems (Drools, CLIPS, PyKnow in Python) Custom Python code with condition\u2013action rules Note: This is a true Simple Reflex Agent \u2014 no LLM, no memory, no reasoning . \u274c Not Ideal (But Possible) CrewAI, LangChain/LangGraph, AutoGen \u2192 These are too heavy for simple reflex use cases. They\u2019re for reasoning, planning, tool use, and autonomous workflows. You can technically implement reflex behavior in them, but it would just be LLM-wrapped if-else rules, which is inefficient. \u2705 Key Characteristics of a Simple Reflex Agent: Action is based only on the current percept. It ignores past percepts (no memory) and does not plan for the future. Uses condition\u2013action rules. Example: If traffic light is red \u2192 stop If traffic light is green \u2192 go No internal state. It doesn\u2019t keep track of what happened before. Efficient but limited. Works only in fully observable environments where the current percept gives enough information to make the right decision. \u2696\ufe0f Advantages Very fast and simple to design. Works well in simple, predictable environments. \u274c Limitations Fails in partially observable or complex environments. Cannot learn or adapt to changes. No memory or long-term strategy. \ud83c\udf0d Domain-Specific Real-Time Examples of Simple Reflex Agents Domain Example Sensors (Percepts) Rules (Condition \u2192 Action) Actuators \ud83c\udfe5 Healthcare Automatic Insulin Pump Glucose sensor If Glucose > threshold \u2192 Inject insulin ; Else \u2192 Do nothing Insulin injector \ud83d\ude97 Automotive Automatic Wipers Rain sensor If Rain detected \u2192 Turn wipers ON ; Else \u2192 OFF Wiper motor \ud83d\ude97 Automotive Automatic Headlights Light sensor If Brightness < threshold \u2192 Lights ON ; Else \u2192 Lights OFF Headlight switch \ud83c\udfed Manufacturing Furnace Temperature Control Thermocouple If Temp < 1200\u00b0C \u2192 Increase gas ; If Temp \u2265 1200\u00b0C \u2192 Cut gas Gas valve \ud83c\udfed Manufacturing Conveyor Belt QC Size/weight sensor If Item defective \u2192 Push off belt ; Else \u2192 Let pass Robotic arm / ejector \ud83c\udfe6 Banking ATM Security (PIN check) Card reader & PIN input If 3 wrong PINs \u2192 Block card ; Else \u2192 Continue ATM system controller \ud83c\udfe0 Smart Home Smart Lights Motion sensor If Motion detected \u2192 Light ON ; If No motion 5 min \u2192 Light OFF Smart light switch \ud83c\udfe0 Smart Home Smart Sprinkler Soil moisture sensor If Moisture < 30% \u2192 Turn sprinkler ON ; Else OFF Water pump \u2708\ufe0f Aviation Landing Gear Warning System Altitude sensor + Gear status If Altitude < 1000 ft AND Gear not down \u2192 Alarm ON ; Else \u2192 Do nothing Alarm system \ud83e\udde0 Agentic AI Frameworks \u2013 Comparison for Simple Reflex Agent: Framework Agent Architecture Agent Types Supported Orchestration / Flow Tooling / Integrations Best Use Cases CrewAI Multi-agent orchestration with Crew (team of agents) Research Agent, Code Agent, Reviewer Agent, QA Agent, Custom agents Task + Role-based orchestration (assign roles, tasks, dependencies) Python functions, APIs, DB connectors, GitHub, Slack, Jira, etc. Collaborative multi-agent workflows (code review, GitHub automation, research & summarization, DevOps pipelines) LangChain / LangGraph Modular chain + graph-based orchestration Conversational agent, Retrieval agent, Tool-using agent, Memory-enabled agent Sequential Chains & Graph DAG execution (LangGraph) 100+ integrations (LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, RAG pipelines, memory) RAG, chatbots, document Q\\&A, knowledge workers, enterprise apps AutoGen (Microsoft) Agent \u2194 Agent conversation paradigm Assistant Agent, User Proxy Agent, Custom Multi-agent teams Conversation-based orchestration (agents talk to each other) Python code execution, Web search, APIs, Data pipelines AI coding assistants, self-correcting agents, reasoning loops Google AI Agent Builder (ADK) Pre-built + customizable agents Chatbots, RAG Agents, Workflow agents Declarative agent builder, UI + API GCP services (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Drive) Customer support, search, enterprise knowledge assistants AWS Bedrock Serverless orchestration for LLM apps Reasoning agent, Knowledge agent, Orchestration agent Managed orchestration (Amazon Agents for Bedrock) AWS ecosystem (S3, DynamoDB, SageMaker, API Gateway, Lambda) Enterprise AI apps, RAG, financial & retail AI copilots, compliance-heavy use cases \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Simple Reflex Agent \u2013 Architecture +-----------------+ | Environment | +-----------------+ ^ | (Changes Environment) | +-----------------+ +--------------------------------+ | Actuators | < --- |Condition - Action Rules (if - then)| +-----------------+ | | ^ | \"What action should I take?\" | | +--------------------------------+ | (Action) ^ | | | | +-----------------+ +--------------------------------+ | Sensors | --- > | \"What is the world like?\" | +-----------------+ +--------------------------------+ ^ | (Percepts) | +-----------------+ | Environment | +-----------------+ 2.

Adaptive: They update their internal model based on new information which allows them to adapt to changes in the environment. Better Decision-Making: The ability to refer to the internal model helps agents make more informed decisions which reduces the risk of making impulsive or suboptimal choices. Increased Complexity: Maintaining an internal model increases computational demands which requires more memory and processing power to track changes in the environment. \ud83d\udd11 Key Takeaways: Simple Reflex Agents \u2192 Best suited for rule-based systems (Google ADK fits well, LangChain can do it but heavy). Model-Based Reflex Agents \u2192 Need state/memory \u2192 CrewAI, LangChain/LangGraph, and Google ADK are strongest.

Goal-based AI Agents: Goal-based AI agents represent a sophisticated approach in artificial intelligence (AI), where agents are programmed to achieve specific objectives. These agents are designed to plan, execute, and adjust their actions dynamically to meet predefined goals. This approach is particularly useful in complex environments where flexibility and adaptability are crucial. Key Concepts of Goal-Based AI Agents # 1. Goals # Planning Execution Adaptation 2. Components of Goal-Based AI Agents # Perception Module Knowledge Base Decision-Making Module Planning Module Execution Module 3. Types of Goal-Based Agents # Reactive Agents Deliberative Agents Hybrid Agents Learning Agents 4. Applications of Goal-Based Agents # Robotics Game AI Autonomous Vehicles Resource Management Healthcare 5. Challenges and Future Directions # Complexity and Computation Uncertainty and Adaptation Ethical and Safety Concerns Future Directions Key Concepts of Goal-Based AI Agents # Goals Goals are the specific objectives that the agent aims to achieve. These can range from simple tasks, such as sorting objects, to complex missions, such as navigating a robot through a maze, solving a puzzle, or managing resources in a simulated environment. Goals provide a clear direction for the agent's actions and decisions. Planning Planning involves determining the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal. This process can be complex, involving predictive models, heuristics, and algorithms to evaluate possible future states and actions. Effective planning allows agents to anticipate potential obstacles and devise strategies to overcome them. Execution Execution is the phase where the agent carries out the planned actions. This involves interacting with the environment and performing tasks that bring the agent closer to its goal. Successful execution requires precise coordination of actions and real-time responsiveness to changes in the environment. Adaptation Adaptation is essential as the agent interacts with its environment. It may encounter unexpected obstacles or changes, and adaptation involves modifying plans and actions in response to new information, ensuring the agent remains on track to achieve its goal. This ability to adapt makes goal-based agents robust and flexible. Components of Goal-Based AI Agents Perception Module The perception module is responsible for collecting data from the environment using sensors or input mechanisms and processing this data to form a coherent understanding of the current state. This information is crucial for informed decision-making and planning. Knowledge Base The knowledge base includes the world model, which is a representation of the environment and the agent\u2019s understanding of it, as well as the rules and facts about how the world operates and the rules governing the agent\u2019s actions. This structured knowledge helps the agent to interpret sensory data and make logical decisions. Decision-Making Module The decision-making module involves goal formulation, where the goals are defined and updated based on the current state and objectives, and action selection, where actions are chosen based on the current state, goals, and predicted outcomes. This module ensures that the agent's actions are aligned with its objectives. Planning Module The planning module handles path planning, determining the optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal, and contingency planning, developing alternative plans in case of unexpected changes or failures. Effective planning minimizes the risk of failure and enhances the agent's efficiency. Execution Module The execution module is responsible for carrying out the planned actions in the environment, and for monitoring and feedback, continuously monitoring the results of actions and adjusting plans as needed. This module ensures that the agent remains responsive to real-time changes and maintains progress towards its goal. Types of Goal-Based Agents Reactive Agents Reactive agents operate based on immediate perceptions and pre-defined rules. They quickly respond to changes in the environment without long-term planning. These agents are suitable for simple tasks where rapid response is more important than complex decision-making. Deliberative Agents Deliberative agents involve a higher level of planning and reasoning. They create detailed plans and execute them, adjusting their actions based on feedback and changes in the environment. These agents are suitable for complex tasks that require strategic thinking and adaptability. Hybrid Agents Hybrid agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches. They can respond quickly to changes while also engaging in higher-level planning when necessary. This combination allows them to handle a wide range of tasks with varying complexity and urgency. Learning Agents Learning agents can adapt their strategies and improve performance over time by learning from their interactions with the environment. They use techniques like reinforcement learning to enhance their ability to achieve goals. Learning agents are particularly useful in dynamic environments where conditions and requirements change frequently. \ud83e\udde0 Goal-Based Agents \u2013 Structured View Aspect Details Suitable Frameworks - LangChain / LangGraph (goal-directed planning with chains & memory) - AutoGen (multi-agent collaboration to achieve goals) - CrewAI (team of agents aligned to a goal, role-based execution) - Haystack (goal-based retrieval-augmented generation) - BabyAGI / Task-driven frameworks (goal-driven task decomposition & execution) Key Characteristics - Decisions depend on goals, not just current state - Requires planning & search to achieve goals - Can evaluate multiple actions and select the one aligned with the final objective - Uses reasoning, knowledge base, and inference - More flexible and adaptive than reflex agents Domain-Specific Real-Time Examples - Healthcare : AI treatment planner deciding best therapy for a patient (goal = patient recovery) - Finance : Robo-advisor optimizing portfolio allocation for target ROI - Autonomous Driving : Car plans optimal route considering traffic & safety (goal = reach destination safely) - Customer Service : AI assistant aiming to resolve customer queries with minimal interactions - DevOps : Automated incident resolution agent targeting service uptime & SLA compliance Agentic AI Frameworks \u2013 Comparison LangChain / LangGraph \u2192 Best for building structured, goal-oriented workflows with memory & reasoning AutoGen \u2192 Useful for multi-agent collaboration toward a shared goal (e.g., one agent plans, another executes) CrewAI \u2192 Best when a team of agents with specialized roles must collectively achieve a business goal BabyAGI \u2192 Great for iterative task decomposition to achieve open-ended goals Haystack \u2192 Best when goals rely on retrieval & knowledge-based reasoning Architecture - Goal Module \u2192 Defines target state - Knowledge Base \u2192 Stores domain/world model - Inference Engine \u2192 Plans sequence of actions - Decision-Making Unit \u2192 Chooses action based on goal satisfaction - Execution Module \u2192 Acts in environment - Feedback Loop \u2192 Evaluates progress toward goal Key Takeaways \u2705 Goal-based agents provide flexibility & reasoning beyond reflex agents. \u2705 They require planning, memory, and decision evaluation . \u2705 Agentic AI frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI are well-suited. \u2705 Real-world use cases include healthcare, finance, autonomous driving, DevOps, and customer service . \u2705 Architecture emphasizes goal setting, planning, execution, and feedback .

Utility-Based Agents: Artificial Intelligence has boomed in growth in recent years. Various types of intelligent agents are being developed to solve complex problems. Utility-based agents hold a strong position due to their ability to make rational decisions based on a utility function. These agents are designed to optimize their performance by maximizing utility measures. Utility-based agents extend goal-based reasoning by considering not only whether a goal is met but also how valuable or desirable a particular outcome is. They use a utility function to quantify preferences and make trade-offs between competing objectives, enabling nuanced decision-making in uncertain or resource-limited situations. Designing an appropriate utility function is crucial for their effectiveness. What is Utility Theory? Utility theory is a fundamental concept in economics and decision theory. This theory provides a framework for understanding how individuals make choices under uncertainty. The aim of this agent is not only to achieve the goal but the best possible way to reach the goal. This idea suggests that people give a value to each possible result of a choice showing how much they like or are happy with that result. The aim is to get the highest expected value, which is the average of the values of all possible results taking into account how likely each one is to happen. Rational decision making Rational Decision making means picking the option that maximizes an agent's expected utility. i.e. give the best outcome. When it comes to AI, a rational agent always goes for the action that leads to the best results, given its current knowledge and the possible future states of the environment. To do this, the agent needs a utility function, which is a way to measure how good each option is. This helps the agent figure out which action will likely give the best results. h3 style=\"color:blue;\">\ud83e\udde0 Utility-Based Agents Aspect Details Suitable Frameworks - LangChain / LangGraph \u2192 define utility functions for selecting best plan - CrewAI \u2192 multi-agent setup where agents vote on best option - AutoGen \u2192 negotiation-based decision-making - Ray RLlib / Stable Baselines \u2192 when reinforcement learning utility optimization is needed Key Characteristics - Choose actions not only to achieve goals but also to maximize performance/utility - Introduces preference ranking among states (e.g., \u201cbetter\u201d vs. \u201cworse\u201d outcomes) - Balances trade-offs (speed vs. cost, accuracy vs. computation) - Often leverages reinforcement learning or optimization models Domain-Specific Real-Time Examples - Autonomous Vehicles \u2192 deciding safest + fastest route balancing time, fuel, and risk - Healthcare AI \u2192 recommending treatment with best success probability & least side effects - Retail Dynamic Pricing \u2192 adjusting prices based on demand elasticity to maximize revenue - Cloud Resource Allocation \u2192 balancing cost vs. performance in real time Agentic AI Frameworks \u2013 Comparison - LangChain / LangGraph \u2192 utility functions as evaluators for agent outputs - CrewAI \u2192 multiple agents propose, then utility scoring selects optimal - AutoGen \u2192 conversational negotiation, pick action with highest expected utility - RL frameworks (Ray RLlib, SB3) \u2192 explicitly optimize reward signals for utility Utility-Based Agents \u2013 Architecture 1.

Learning Agents: Learning agents improve their performance over time by learning from experience and updating their internal models, strategies or policies. They can adapt to changes in the environment and often outperform static agents in dynamic contexts. Learning may involve supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning techniques and these agents typically contain both a performance element (for acting) and a learning element (for improving future actions). Key Characteristics: Adaptive Learning: It improve their decision-making through continuous feedback from their actions. Exploration vs. Exploitation: These agents balance exploring new actions that may lead to better outcomes with exploiting known successful strategies. Flexibility: They can adapt to a wide variety of tasks or environments by modifying their behavior based on new data.

The LLM queries knowledge, classifies, and flags anomalies. Acts as an Orchestrator : routes queries \u2192 retrieves patterns \u2192 calls APIs \u2192 flags suspicious activity. Strong at retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) , integrating structured + unstructured data, and explainability. Needs custom logic for decision-making & multi-agent coordination . CrewAI Define multiple agents: e.g., Transaction Analyzer Agent (checks real-time payments), Pattern Detection Agent (compares with fraud signatures), Escalation Agent (notifies compliance team). CrewAI coordinates them. Multi-Agent Collaboration : Specialized agents working together for detection, decision, escalation. Clear separation of responsibilities, human-in-the-loop, transparency. Can be complex to design & optimize for real-time latency-sensitive use cases . AutoGen Create conversational agents where one agent monitors transactions, another challenges suspicious cases (\u201cExplain why this looks fraudulent\u201d), and a supervisor agent decides the final action. Agents communicate iteratively. Dialogue-driven multi-agent workflow for fraud classification, justification, and escalation. Strong at LLM-to-LLM communication , scenario simulation, and iterative reasoning . Might add overhead if immediate, low-latency decisions are needed (e.g., payments approval). RLlib (Reinforcement Learning) Train an RL agent that learns fraud detection policies over time by maximizing reward (catching fraud, minimizing false positives). It continuously improves from transaction feedback. Learning Agent : adapts fraud detection policies dynamically. Handles real-time decision-making under uncertainty, improves over time. Needs large-scale data & training; interpretability can be challenging compared to symbolic/logical reasoning. 6. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): Multi-agent systems operate in environments shared with other agents, either cooperating or competing to achieve individual or group goals. These systems are decentralized, often requiring communication, negotiation or coordination protocols. They are well-suited to distributed problem solving but can be complex to design due to emergent and unpredictable behaviors. Types of multi-agent systems: Cooperative MAS: Agents work together toward shared objectives. Competitive MAS: Agents pursue individual goals that may conflict. Mixed MAS: Agents cooperate in some scenarios and compete in others. Key Characteristics: Autonomous Agents: Each agent acts on its own based on its goals and knowledge. Interactions: Agents communicate, cooperate or compete to achieve individual or shared objectives. Distributed Problem Solving: Agents work together to solve complex problems more efficiently than they could alone. Decentralization: No central control, agents make decisions independently. \ud83e\udde9 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) \u2013 Structured View: Dimension Description Examples Definition A system composed of multiple interacting agents, each with autonomy, situatedness, and ability to collaborate/compete.

Hierarchical agents Hierarchical agents organize behavior into multiple layers such as strategic, tactical and operational. Higher levels make abstract decisions that break down into more specific subgoals for lower levels to execute. This structure improves scalability, reusability of skills and management of complex tasks, but requires designing effective interfaces between layers. Key Characteristics: Structured Decision-Making: Decision-making is divided into different levels for more efficient task handling. Task Division: Complex tasks are broken down into simpler subtasks. Control and Guidance: Higher levels direct lower levels for coordinated action. \ud83e\udde9 Hierarchical Agents \u2013 Structured View: Aspect Details Definition Hierarchical Agents are agents that decompose complex problems into multiple layers (high-level \u2192 mid-level \u2192 low-level tasks). Each level manages sub-tasks and coordinates with others to achieve the overall objective. Key Characteristics - Task decomposition into levels - Abstraction between layers - Coordination & communication across layers - Top-down control (high-level sets goals, low-level executes) - Reusability of sub-modules Architecture - High-Level Layer : Defines goals, strategies, and overall planning - Mid-Level Layer : Translates goals into sub-goals & manages workflows - Low-Level Layer : Executes primitive actions and handles environment interaction Advantages - Simplifies complex decision-making - Improves scalability and modularity - Allows specialization at different layers - Easier debugging & monitoring Challenges - Coordination overhead - Failure in lower layer impacts higher-level goals - Requires robust communication mechanisms - Complexity in dynamic/adaptive environments Domain-Specific Example Autonomous Vehicles - High-Level : Plan route from City A \u2192 City B - Mid-Level : Break route into road segments, traffic lights, lane selection -

These can range from simple tasks, such as sorting objects, to complex missions, such as navigating a robot through a maze, solving a puzzle, or managing resources in a simulated environment. Goals provide a clear direction for the agent's actions and decisions. Planning Planning involves determining the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal. This process can be complex, involving predictive models, heuristics, and algorithms to evaluate possible future states and actions. Effective planning allows agents to anticipate potential obstacles and devise strategies to overcome them. Execution Execution is the phase where the agent carries out the planned actions. This involves interacting with the environment and performing tasks that bring the agent closer to its goal. Successful execution requires precise coordination of actions and real-time responsiveness to changes in the environment. Adaptation Adaptation is essential as the agent interacts with its environment. It may encounter unexpected obstacles or changes, and adaptation involves modifying plans and actions in response to new information, ensuring the agent remains on track to achieve its goal. This ability to adapt makes goal-based agents robust and flexible. Components of Goal-Based AI Agents Perception Module The perception module is responsible for collecting data from the environment using sensors or input mechanisms and processing this data to form a coherent understanding of the current state. This information is crucial for informed decision-making and planning. Knowledge Base The knowledge base includes the world model, which is a representation of the environment and the agent\u2019s understanding of it, as well as the rules and facts about how the world operates and the rules governing the agent\u2019s actions. This structured knowledge helps the agent to interpret sensory data and make logical decisions. Decision-Making Module The decision-making module involves goal formulation, where the goals are defined and updated based on the current state and objectives, and action selection, where actions are chosen based on the current state, goals, and predicted outcomes. This module ensures that the agent's actions are aligned with its objectives. Planning Module The planning module handles path planning, determining the optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal, and contingency planning, developing alternative plans in case of unexpected changes or failures. Effective planning minimizes the risk of failure and enhances the agent's efficiency. Execution Module The execution module is responsible for carrying out the planned actions in the environment, and for monitoring and feedback, continuously monitoring the results of actions and adjusting plans as needed. This module ensures that the agent remains responsive to real-time changes and maintains progress towards its goal. Types of Goal-Based Agents Reactive Agents Reactive agents operate based on immediate perceptions and pre-defined rules. They quickly respond to changes in the environment without long-term planning. These agents are suitable for simple tasks where rapid response is more important than complex decision-making. Deliberative Agents Deliberative agents involve a higher level of planning and reasoning. They create detailed plans and execute them, adjusting their actions based on feedback and changes in the environment. These agents are suitable for complex tasks that require strategic thinking and adaptability. Hybrid Agents Hybrid agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches. They can respond quickly to changes while also engaging in higher-level planning when necessary. This combination allows them to handle a wide range of tasks with varying complexity and urgency. Learning Agents Learning agents can adapt their strategies and improve performance over time by learning from their interactions with the environment. They use techniques like reinforcement learning to enhance their ability to achieve goals. Learning agents are particularly useful in dynamic environments where conditions and requirements change frequently.","title":"Key Concepts of Goal-Based AI Agents"},{"location":"AgenticAI/GCP/Agents.html","text":"\u2705 Agents \ud83d\udccc What is Agents? In the Agent Development Kit (ADK), an Agent is a self-contained execution unit designed to act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Agents can perform tasks, interact with users, utilize external tools, and coordinate with other agents. The foundation for all agents in ADK is the BaseAgent class. It serves as the fundamental blueprint. To create functional agents, you typically extend BaseAgent in one of three main ways, catering to different needs \u2013 from intelligent reasoning to structured process control. \ud83d\udccc Core Agent Categories ADK provides distinct agent categories to build sophisticated applications: \u2705 LLM Agents (LlmAgent, Agent): These agents utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as their core engine to understand natural language, reason, plan, generate responses, and dynamically decide how to proceed or which tools to use, making them ideal for flexible, language-centric tasks. \u2705 Workflow Agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent): These specialized agents control the execution flow of other agents in predefined, deterministic patterns (sequence, parallel, or loop) without using an LLM for the flow control itself, perfect for structured processes needing predictable execution. \u2705 Custom Agents: Created by extending BaseAgent directly, these agents allow you to implement unique operational logic, specific control flows, or specialized integrations not covered by the standard types, catering to highly tailored application requirements. \ud83d\udccc Choosing the Right Agent Type Feature LLM Agent ( LlmAgent ) Workflow Agent Custom Agent ( BaseAgent subclass) Primary Function Reasoning, Generation, Tool Use Controlling Agent Execution Flow Implementing Unique Logic/Integrations Core Engine Large Language Model (LLM) Predefined Logic (Sequence, Parallel, Loop) Custom Code Determinism Non-deterministic (Flexible) Deterministic (Predictable) Can be either, based on implementation Primary Use Language tasks, Dynamic decisions Structured processes, Orchestration Tailored requirements, Specific workflows \ud83d\udccc Agents Working Together: Multi-Agent Systems While each agent type serves a distinct purpose, the true power often comes from combining them. Complex applications frequently employ multi-agent architectures where: LLM Agents handle intelligent, language-based task execution. Workflow Agents manage the overall process flow using standard patterns. Custom Agents provide specialized capabilities or rules needed for unique integrations. \ud83d\udccc LLM Agents: The LlmAgent (often aliased simply as Agent) is a core component in ADK, acting as the \"thinking\" part of your application. It leverages the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning, understanding natural language, making decisions, generating responses, and interacting with tools. Unlike deterministic Workflow Agents that follow predefined execution paths, LlmAgent behavior is non-deterministic. It uses the LLM to interpret instructions and context, deciding dynamically how to proceed, which tools to use (if any), or whether to transfer control to another agent. Building an effective LlmAgent involves defining its identity, clearly guiding its behavior through instructions, and equipping it with the necessary tools and capabilities. \ud83d\udccc Defining the Agent's Identity and Purpose: First, you need to establish what the agent is and what it's for. name (Required): Every agent needs a unique string identifier. This name is crucial for internal operations, especially in multi-agent systems where agents need to refer to or delegate tasks to each other. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the agent's function (e.g., customer_support_router , billing_inquiry_agent ). Avoid reserved names like user . description (Optional, Recommended for Multi-Agent): Provide a concise summary of the agent's capabilities. This description is primarily used by other LLM agents to determine if they should route a task to this agent. Make it specific enough to differentiate it from peers (e.g., \"Handles inquiries about current billing statements,\" not just \"Billing agent\"). model (Required): Specify the underlying LLM that will power this agent's reasoning. This is a string identifier like \"gemini-2.0-flash\" . The choice of model impacts the agent's capabilities, cost, and performance. See the Models page for available options and considerations. # Example: Defining the basic identity capital_agent = LlmAgent ( model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\" , name = \"capital_agent\" , description = \"Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.\" # instruction and tools will be added next ) \ud83d\udccc Guiding the Agent: Instructions (instruction) The instruction parameter is arguably the most critical for shaping an LlmAgent's behavior. It's a string (or a function returning a string) that tells the agent: Its core task or goal. Its personality or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant,\" \"You are a witty pirate\"). Constraints on its behavior (e.g., \"Only answer questions about X,\" \"Never reveal Y\"). How and when to use its tools . You should explain the purpose of each tool and the circumstances under which it should be called, supplementing any descriptions within the tool itself. The desired format for its output (e.g., \"Respond in JSON,\" \"Provide a bulleted list\"). \ud83d\udccc Tips for Effective Instructions: Be Clear and Specific: Avoid ambiguity. Clearly state the desired actions and outcomes. Use Markdown: Improve readability for complex instructions using headings, lists, etc. Provide Examples (Few-Shot): For complex tasks or specific output formats, include examples directly in the instruction. Guide Tool Use: Don't just list tools; explain when and why the agent should use them. \ud83d\udccc State: The instruction is a string template, you can use the {var} syntax to insert dynamic values into the instruction. {var} is used to insert the value of the state variable named var. {artifact.var} is used to insert the text content of the artifact named var. If the state variable or artifact does not exist, the agent will raise an error. If you want to ignore the error, you can append a ? to the variable name as in {var?} . # Example: Adding instructions capital_agent = LlmAgent ( model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\" , name = \"capital_agent\" , description = \"Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.\" , instruction = \" \"\" You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country. When a user asks for the capital of a country: 1. Identify the country name from the user's query. 2. Use the `get_capital_city` tool to find the capital. 3. Respond clearly to the user, stating the capital city. Example Query: \" What 's the capital of {country}?\" Example Response: \"The capital of France is Paris.\" \"\"\", # tools will be added next ) Note: For instructions that apply to all agents in a system, consider using global_instruction on the root agent. \ud83d\udccc Equipping the Agent: Tools (tools) Tools give your LlmAgent capabilities beyond the LLM's built-in knowledge or reasoning. They allow the agent to interact with the outside world, perform calculations, fetch real-time data, or execute specific actions. tools (Optional) : Provide a list of tools the agent can use. Each item in the list can be: A native function or method (wrapped as a FunctionTool). Python ADK automatically wraps the native function into a FuntionTool whereas, you must explicitly wrap your Java methods using FunctionTool.create(...) An instance of a class inheriting from BaseTool . An instance of another agent AgentTool, enabling agent-to-agent delegation. The LLM uses the function/tool names, descriptions (from docstrings or the description field), and parameter schemas to decide which tool to call based on the conversation and its instructions. # Define a tool function def get_capital_city ( country : str ) -> str : \"\"\"Retrieves the capital city for a given country.\"\"\" # Replace with actual logic ( e . g ., API call , database lookup ) capitals = { \"france\" : \"Paris\" , \"japan\" : \"Tokyo\" , \"canada\" : \"Ottawa\" } return capitals . get ( country . lower (), f \"Sorry, I don't know the capital of {country}.\" ) # Add the tool to the agent capital_agent = LlmAgent ( model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\" , name = \"capital_agent\" , description = \"Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.\" , instruction = \"\"\"You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country... (previous instruction text)\"\"\" , tools =[ get_capital_city ] # Provide the function directly ) \ud83d\udccc Advanced Configuration & Control Beyond the core parameters, LlmAgent offers several options for finer control: Configuring LLM Generation (generate_content_config) You can adjust how the underlying LLM generates responses using generate_content_config . generate_content_config (Optional) : Pass an instance of google.genai.types.GenerateContentConfig to control parameters like temperature (randomness), max_output_tokens (response length), top_p, top_k, and safety settings. from google.genai import types agent = LlmAgent ( # ... other params generate_content_config = types . GenerateContentConfig ( temperature = 0.2 , # More deterministic output max_output_tokens = 250 , safety_settings = [ types . SafetySetting ( category = types . HarmCategory . HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT , threshold = types . HarmBlockThreshold . BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE , ) ] ) ) Structuring Data (input_schema, output_schema, output_key) For scenarios requiring structured data exchange with an LLM Agent, the ADK provides mechanisms to define expected input and desired output formats using schema definitions. input_schema (Optional): Define a schema representing the expected input structure. If set, the user message content passed to this agent must be a JSON string conforming to this schema. Your instructions should guide the user or preceding agent accordingly. output_schema (Optional): Define a schema representing the desired output structure. If set, the agent's final response must be a JSON string conforming to this schema. output_key (Optional): Provide a string key. If set, the text content of the agent's final response will be automatically saved to the session's state dictionary under this key. This is useful for passing results between agents or steps in a workflow. In Python, this might look like: session.state[output_key] = agent_response_text from pydantic import BaseModel , Field class CapitalOutput ( BaseModel ): capital : str = Field ( description = \"The capital of the country.\" ) structured_capital_agent = LlmAgent ( # ... name, model, description instruction = \"\"\"You are a Capital Information Agent. Given a country, respond ONLY with a JSON object containing the capital. Format: {\"capital\": \"capital_name\"}\"\"\" , output_schema = CapitalOutput , # Enforce JSON output output_key = \"found_capital\" # Store result in state['found_capital'] # Cannot use tools=[get_capital_city] effectively here ) \ud83d\udccc Managing Context (include_contents) Control whether the agent receives the prior conversation history. include_contents (Optional, Default: 'default'): Determines if the contents (history) are sent to the LLM. 'default': The agent receives the relevant conversation history. 'none': The agent receives no prior contents. It operates based solely on its current instruction and any input provided in the current turn (useful for stateless tasks or enforcing specific contexts). stateless_agent = LlmAgent( # ... other params include_contents='none' ) \ud83d\udccc Planner planner (Optional): Assign a BasePlanner instance to enable multi-step reasoning and planning before execution. There are two main planners: BuiltInPlanner: Leverages the model's built-in planning capabilities (e.g., Gemini's thinking feature) Here, the thinking_budget parameter guides the model on the number of thinking tokens to use when generating a response. The include_thoughts parameter controls whether the model should include its raw thoughts and internal reasoning process in the response. from google.adk import Agent from google.adk.planners import BuiltInPlanner from google.genai import types my_agent = Agent ( model = \"gemini-2.5-flash\" , planner = BuiltInPlanner ( thinking_config = types . ThinkingConfig ( include_thoughts = True , thinking_budget = 1024 , ) ), # ... your tools here ) PlanReActPlanner: This planner instructs the model to follow a specific structure in its output: first create a plan, then execute actions (like calling tools), and provide reasoning for its steps. It's particularly useful for models that don't have a built-in \"thinking\" feature. from google.adk import Agent from google.adk.planners import PlanReActPlanner my_agent = Agent ( model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\" , planner = PlanReActPlanner (), # ... your tools here ) The agent's response will follow a structured format: [ user ] : ai news [ google_search_agent ] : /*PLANNING*/ 1. Perform a Google search for \"latest AI news\" to get current updates and headlines related to artificial intelligence . 2. Synthesize the information from the search results to provide a summary of recent AI news . /*ACTION*/ /*REASONING*/ The search results provide a comprehensive overview of recent AI news , covering various aspects like company developments , research breakthroughs , and applications . I have enough information to answer the user 's request. /*FINAL_ANSWER*/ Here' s a summary of recent AI news : .... \ud83d\udccc Code Execution code_executor (Optional): Provide a BaseCodeExecutor instance to allow the agent to execute code blocks found in the LLM's response. Example for using built-in-planner: from dotenv import load_dotenv import asyncio import os from google.genai import types from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent from google.adk.runners import Runner from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService from google.adk.artifacts.in_memory_artifact_service import InMemoryArtifactService # Optional from google.adk.planners import BasePlanner , BuiltInPlanner , PlanReActPlanner from google.adk.models import LlmRequest from google.genai.types import ThinkingConfig from google.genai.types import GenerateContentConfig import datetime from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo APP_NAME = \"weather_app\" USER_ID = \"1234\" SESSION_ID = \"session1234\" def get_weather ( city : str ) -> dict : \"\"\"Retrieves the current weather report for a specified city.

Workflow agents are specialized components in ADK designed purely for orchestrating the execution flow of sub-agents . Their primary role is to manage how and when other agents run, defining the control flow of a process. Unlike LLM Agents, which use Large Language Models for dynamic reasoning and decision-making, Workflow Agents operate based on predefined logic . They determine the execution sequence according to their type (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop) without consulting an LLM for the orchestration itself. This results in deterministic and predictable execution patterns . ADK provides three core workflow agent types, each implementing a distinct execution pattern: Sequential Agents Loop Agents Parallel Agents \ud83d\udccc Why Use Workflow Agents? Workflow agents are essential when you need explicit control over how a series of tasks or agents are executed. They provide: Predictability: The flow of execution is guaranteed based on the agent type and configuration. Reliability: Ensures tasks run in the required order or pattern consistently. Structure: Allows you to build complex processes by composing agents within clear control structures. \ud83d\udccc Sequential agents The SequentialAgent is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in the list. Example: You want to build an agent that can summarize any webpage, using two tools: Get Page Contents and Summarize Page. Because the agent must always call Get Page Contents before calling Summarize Page (you can't summarize from nothing!), you should build your agent using a SequentialAgent. As with other workflow agents, the SequentialAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are concerned only with their execution (i.e. in sequence), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs. How it works When the SequentialAgent 's Run Async method is called, it performs the following actions: Iteration: It iterates through the sub agents list in the order they were provided. Sub-Agent Execution: For each sub-agent in the list, it calls the sub-agent's Run Async method. Full Example: Code Development Pipeline Consider a simplified code development pipeline: Code Writer Agent: An LLM Agent that generates initial code based on a specification. Code Reviewer Agent: An LLM Agent that reviews the generated code for errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices. It receives the output of the Code Writer Agent. Code Refactorer Agent: An LLM Agent that takes the reviewed code (and the reviewer's comments) and refactors it to improve quality and address issues. A SequentialAgent is perfect for this: SequentialAgent(sub_agents=[CodeWriterAgent, CodeReviewerAgent, CodeRefactorerAgent]) This ensures the code is written, then reviewed, and finally refactored, in a strict, dependable order. The output from each sub-agent is passed to the next by storing them in state via Output Key . Shared Invocation Context The SequentialAgent passes the same InvocationContext to each of its sub-agents. This means they all share the same session state, including the temporary (temp:) namespace, making it easy to pass data between steps within a single turn. # Part of agent.py --> Follow https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/ to learn the setup # --- 1.

It repeatedly runs a sequence of agents for a specified number of iterations or until a termination condition is met. Use the LoopAgent when your workflow involves repetition or iterative refinement, such as revising code. Example: You want to build an agent that can generate images of food, but sometimes when you want to generate a specific number of items (e.g. 5 bananas), it generates a different number of those items in the image (e.g. an image of 7 bananas). You have two tools: Generate Image , Count Food Items . Because you want to keep generating images until it either correctly generates the specified number of items, or after a certain number of iterations, you should build your agent using a LoopAgent. As with other workflow agents, the LoopAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned only with their execution (i.e. in a loop), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs. How it Works When the LoopAgent's Run Async method is called, it performs the following actions: Sub-Agent Execution: It iterates through the Sub Agents list in order. For each sub-agent, it calls the agent's Run Async method. Termination Check: Crucially, the LoopAgent itself does not inherently decide when to stop looping. You must implement a termination mechanism to prevent infinite loops. Common strategies include: Max Iterations: Set a maximum number of iterations in the LoopAgent . The loop will terminate after that many iterations. Escalation from sub-agent: Design one or more sub-agents to evaluate a condition (e.g., \"Is the document quality good enough?\", \"Has a consensus been reached?\"). If the condition is met, the sub-agent can signal termination (e.g., by raising a custom event, setting a flag in a shared context, or returning a specific value). # Part of agent.py --> Follow https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/ to learn the setup import asyncio import os from google.adk.agents import LoopAgent , LlmAgent , BaseAgent , SequentialAgent from google.genai import types from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext from typing import AsyncGenerator , Optional from google.adk.events import Event , EventActions # --- Constants --- APP_NAME = \"doc_writing_app_v3\" # New App Name USER_ID = \"dev_user_01\" SESSION_ID_BASE = \"loop_exit_tool_session\" # New Base Session ID GEMINI_MODEL = \"gemini-2.0-flash\" STATE_INITIAL_TOPIC = \"initial_topic\" # --- State Keys --- STATE_CURRENT_DOC = \"current_document\" STATE_CRITICISM = \"criticism\" # Define the exact phrase the Critic should use to signal completion COMPLETION_PHRASE = \"No major issues found.\" # --- Tool Definition --- def exit_loop ( tool_context : ToolContext ): \"\"\"Call this function ONLY when the critique indicates no further changes are needed, signaling the iterative process should end.\"\"\" print ( f \" [Tool Call] exit_loop triggered by { tool_context . agent_name } \" ) tool_context . actions . escalate = True # Return empty dict as tools should typically return JSON-serializable output return {} # --- Agent Definitions --- # STEP 1: Initial Writer Agent (Runs ONCE at the beginning) initial_writer_agent = LlmAgent ( name = \"InitialWriterAgent\" , model = GEMINI_MODEL , include_contents = 'none' , # MODIFIED Instruction: Ask for a slightly more developed start instruction = f \"\"\"You are a Creative Writing Assistant tasked with starting a story.

This dramatically speeds up workflows where tasks can be performed independently. Use ParallelAgent when: For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, a ParallelAgent facilitates efficient parallel execution. When sub-agents operate without dependencies, their tasks can be performed concurrently , significantly reducing overall processing time. As with other workflow agents, the ParallelAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned with their execution (i.e. executing sub-agents in parallel), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs. Example: This approach is particularly beneficial for operations like multi-source data retrieval or heavy computations, where parallelization yields substantial performance gains. Importantly, this strategy assumes no inherent need for shared state or direct information exchange between the concurrently executing agents. How it works When the ParallelAgent 's run_async() method is called: Concurrent Execution: It initiates the run_async() method of each sub-agent present in the sub_agents list concurrently. This means all the agents start running at (approximately) the same time. Independent Branches: Each sub-agent operates in its own execution branch. There is no automatic sharing of conversation history or state between these branches during execution. Result Collection: The ParallelAgent manages the parallel execution and, typically, provides a way to access the results from each sub-agent after they have completed (e.g., through a list of results or events). The order of results may not be deterministic. Independent Execution and State Management It's crucial to understand that sub-agents within a ParallelAgent run independently. If you need communication or data sharing between these agents, you must implement it explicitly. Possible approaches include: Shared InvocationContext : You could pass a shared InvocationContext object to each sub-agent. This object could act as a shared data store. However, you'd need to manage concurrent access to this shared context carefully (e.g., using locks) to avoid race conditions. External State Management: Use an external database, message queue, or other mechanism to manage shared state and facilitate communication between agents. Post-Processing: Collect results from each branch, and then implement logic to coordinate data afterwards.

This approach is shown because it gives you fine-grained control over the agent's execution lifecycle, session management, and state persistence. \ud83d\udccc Using ADK's Built-in Tools (Web UI / CLI / API Server): If you prefer a setup that handles the runner and session management automatically using ADK's standard tools, That version is designed to be run directly with commands like adk web (for a web UI), adk run (for CLI interaction), or adk api_server (to expose an API). \ud83d\udccc Ready to build your agent team?

This involves creating two core pieces: \u2705 A Tool: A Python function that equips the agent with the ability to fetch weather data. \u2705 An Agent: The AI \"brain\" that understands the user's request, knows it has a weather tool, and decides when and how to use it. \ud83d\udccc Define the Tool (get_weather) In ADK, Tools are the building blocks that give agents concrete capabilities beyond just text generation. They are typically regular Python functions that perform specific actions, like calling an API, querying a database, or performing calculations. Our first tool will provide a mock weather report. This allows us to focus on the agent structure without needing external API keys yet. Later, you could easily swap this mock function with one that calls a real weather service. \ud83d\udccc Key Concept: Docstrings are Crucial! The agent's LLM relies heavily on the function's docstring to understand: What the tool does.? When to use it.? What arguments it requires (city: str).? What information it returns.? \ud83d\udccc Best Practice Write clear, descriptive, and accurate docstrings for your tools. This is essential for the LLM to use the tool correctly. # @title Define the get_weather Tool def get_weather ( city : str ) -> dict : \"\"\"Retrieves the current weather report for a specified city. Args: city (str): The name of the city (e.g., \" New York \", \" London \", \" Tokyo \"). Returns: dict: A dictionary containing the weather information. Includes a 'status' key ('success' or 'error'). If 'success', includes a 'report' key with weather details. If 'error', includes an 'error_message' key. \"\"\" print ( f \"--- Tool: get_weather called for city: {city} ---\" ) # Log tool execution city_normalized = city . lower (). replace ( \" \" , \"\" ) # Basic normalization # Mock weather data mock_weather_db = { \"newyork\" : { \"status\" : \"success\" , \"report\" : \"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25\u00b0C.\" } , \"london\" : { \"status\" : \"success\" , \"report\" : \"It's cloudy in London with a temperature of 15\u00b0C.\" } , \"tokyo\" : { \"status\" : \"success\" , \"report\" : \"Tokyo is experiencing light rain and a temperature of 18\u00b0C.\" } , } if city_normalized in mock_weather_db : return mock_weather_db [ city_normalized ] else : return { \"status\" : \"error\" , \"error_message\" : f \"Sorry, I don't have weather information for '{city}'.\" } # Example tool usage ( optional test ) print ( get_weather ( \"New York\" )) print ( get_weather ( \"Paris\" )) \ud83d\udccc Define the Agent (weather_agent) An Agent in ADK orchestrates the interaction between the user, the LLM, and the available tools. \ud83d\udccc Agents configure it with several key parameters: \u2705 name: A unique identifier for this agent (e.g., \"weather_agent_v1\"). \u2705 model: Specifies which LLM to use (e.g., MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH). \u2705 description: A concise summary of the agent's overall purpose. This becomes crucial later when other agents need to decide whether to delegate tasks to this agent. \u2705 instruction: Detailed guidance for the LLM on how to behave, its persona, its goals, and specifically how and when to utilize its assigned tools . \u2705 tools: A list containing the actual Python tool functions the agent is allowed to use (e.g., [get_weather]). Best Practice: Provide clear and specific instruction prompts. The more detailed the instructions, the better the LLM can understand its role and how to use its tools effectively. Be explicit about error handling if needed. Best Practice: Choose descriptive name and description values. These are used internally by ADK and are vital for features like automatic delegation # @title Define the Weather Agent # Use one of the model constants defined earlier AGENT_MODEL = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH # Starting with Gemini weather_agent = Agent ( name = \"weather_agent_v1\" , model = AGENT_MODEL , # Can be a string for Gemini or a LiteLlm object description = \"Provides weather information for specific cities.\" , instruction = \"You are a helpful weather assistant. \" \"When the user asks for the weather in a specific city, \" \"use the 'get_weather' tool to find the information. \" \"If the tool returns an error, inform the user politely. \" \"If the tool is successful, present the weather report clearly.\" , tools =[ get_weather ] , # Pass the function directly ) print ( f \"Agent '{weather_agent.name}' created using model '{AGENT_MODEL}'.\" ) \ud83d\udccc Setup Runner and Session Service: To manage conversations and execute the agent, we need two more components: \u2705 SessionService: Responsible for managing conversation history and state for different users and sessions. The InMemorySessionService is a simple implementation that stores everything in memory, suitable for testing and simple applications. It keeps track of the messages exchanged. We'll explore state persistence later. \u2705 Runner: The engine that orchestrates the interaction flow. It takes user input, routes it to the appropriate agent, manages calls to the LLM and tools based on the agent's logic, handles session updates via the SessionService , and yields events representing the progress of the interaction. # @title Setup Session Service and Runner # --- Session Management --- # Key Concept: SessionService stores conversation history & state. # InMemorySessionService is simple, non-persistent storage for this tutorial. session_service = InMemorySessionService () # Define constants for identifying the interaction context APP_NAME = \"weather_tutorial_app\" USER_ID = \"user_1\" SESSION_ID = \"session_001\" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity # Create the specific session where the conversation will happen session = await session_service . create_session ( app_name = APP_NAME , user_id = USER_ID , session_id = SESSION_ID ) print ( f \"Session created: App='{APP_NAME}', User='{USER_ID}', Session='{SESSION_ID}'\" ) # --- Runner --- # Key Concept: Runner orchestrates the agent execution loop. runner = Runner ( agent = weather_agent , # The agent we want to run app_name = APP_NAME , # Associates runs with our app session_service = session_service # Uses our session manager ) print ( f \"Runner created for agent '{runner.agent.name}'.\" ) \ud83d\udccc Interact with the Agent We need a way to send messages to our agent and receive its responses. Since LLM calls and tool executions can take time, ADK's Runner operates asynchronously. We'll define an async helper function ( call_agent_async ) that: Takes a user query string. Packages it into the ADK Content format. Calls runner.run_async , providing the user/session context and the new message. Iterates through the Events yielded by the runner. Events represent steps in the agent's execution (e.g., tool call requested, tool result received, intermediate LLM thought, final response). Identifies and prints the final response event using event.is_final_response() Why async? Interactions with LLMs and potentially tools (like external APIs) are I/O-bound operations. Using asyncio allows the program to handle these operations efficiently without blocking execution. # @title Define Agent Interaction Function from google.genai import types # For creating message Content/Parts async def call_agent_async ( query : str , runner , user_id , session_id ): \"\"\"Sends a query to the agent and prints the final response.\"\"\" print ( f \" \\n >>> User Query: { query } \" ) # Prepare the user's message in ADK format content = types . Content ( role = 'user' , parts = [ types . Part ( text = query )]) final_response_text = \"Agent did not produce a final response.\" # Default # Key Concept: run_async executes the agent logic and yields Events. # We iterate through events to find the final answer. async for event in runner . run_async ( user_id = user_id , session_id = session_id , new_message = content ): # You can uncomment the line below to see *all* events during execution # print(f\" [Event] Author: {event.author}, Type: {type(event).__name__}, Final: {event.is_final_response()}, Content: {event.content}\") # Key Concept: is_final_response() marks the concluding message for the turn. if event . is_final_response (): if event . content and event . content . parts : # Assuming text response in the first part final_response_text = event . content . parts [ 0 ] . text elif event . actions and event . actions . escalate : # Handle potential errors/escalations final_response_text = f \"Agent escalated: { event . error_message or 'No specific message.' } \" # Add more checks here if needed (e.g., specific error codes) break # Stop processing events once the final response is found print ( f \"<<< Agent Response: { final_response_text } \" ) \ud83d\udccc Run the Conversation Finally, let's test our setup by sending a few queries to the agent. We wrap our async calls in a main async function and run it using await . \u2705 Run the Initial Conversation: # @title Run the Initial Conversation # We need an async function to await our interaction helper async def run_conversation (): await call_agent_async ( \"What is the weather like in London?\" , runner = runner , user_id = USER_ID , session_id = SESSION_ID ) await call_agent_async ( \"How about Paris?\" , runner = runner , user_id = USER_ID , session_id = SESSION_ID ) # Expecting the tool's error message await call_agent_async ( \"Tell me the weather in New York\" , runner = runner , user_id = USER_ID , session_id = SESSION_ID ) # Execute the conversation using await in an async context (like Colab/Jupyter) await run_conversation () # --- OR --- # Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (.py file): # import asyncio # if __name__ == \"__main__\": # try: # asyncio.run(run_conversation()) # except Exception as e: # print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\") \ud83d\udccc Multi-Model with LiteLLM We built a functional Weather Agent powered by a specific Gemini model. While effective, real-world applications often benefit from the flexibility to use different Large Language Models (LLMs). Why? Performance: Some models excel at specific tasks (e.g., coding, reasoning, creative writing). Cost: Different models have varying price points. Capabilities: Models offer diverse features, context window sizes, and fine-tuning options. Availability/Redundancy: Having alternatives ensures your application remains functional even if one provider experiences issues. ADK makes switching between models seamless through its integration with the LiteLLM library. LiteLLM acts as a consistent interface to over 100 different LLMs. Learn how to configure an ADK Agent to use models from providers like OpenAI (GPT) and Anthropic (Claude) using the LiteLlm wrapper. Learn how to configure an ADK Agent to use models from providers like OpenAI (GPT) and Anthropic (Claude) using the LiteLlm wrapper. Interact with these different agents to observe potential variations in their responses, even when using the same underlying tool. \u2705 Import LiteLlm # @title 1. Import LiteLlm from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm \u2705 Define and Test Multi-Model Agents Instead of passing only a model name string (which defaults to Google's Gemini models), we wrap the desired model identifier string within the LiteLlm class. Key Concept: LiteLlm Wrapper: The LiteLlm(model=\"provider/model_name\") syntax tells ADK to route requests for this agent through the LiteLLM library to the specified model provider. Best Practice: Use constants for model names (like MODEL_GPT_4O, MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET defined in Step 0) to avoid typos and make code easier to manage. Error Handling: We wrap the agent definitions in try...except blocks. This prevents the entire code cell from failing if an API key for a specific provider is missing or invalid. \ud83d\udccc First, let's create and test the agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o. # @title Define and Test GPT Agent # Make sure 'get_weather' function from Step 1 is defined in your environment . # Make sure 'call_agent_async' is defined from earlier . # --- Agent using GPT-4o --- weather_agent_gpt = None # Initialize to None runner_gpt = None # Initialize runner to None try : weather_agent_gpt = Agent ( name = \"weather_agent_gpt\" , # Key change : Wrap the LiteLLM model identifier model = LiteLlm ( model = MODEL_GPT_4O ), description = \"Provides weather information (using GPT-4o).\" , instruction = \"You are a helpful weather assistant powered by GPT-4o. \" \"Use the 'get_weather' tool for city weather requests. \" \"Clearly present successful reports or polite error messages based on the tool's output status.\" , tools =[ get_weather ] , # Re - use the same tool ) print ( f \"Agent '{weather_agent_gpt.name}' created using model '{MODEL_GPT_4O}'.\" ) # InMemorySessionService is simple , non - persistent storage for this tutorial . session_service_gpt = InMemorySessionService () # Create a dedicated service # Define constants for identifying the interaction context APP_NAME_GPT = \"weather_tutorial_app_gpt\" # Unique app name for this test USER_ID_GPT = \"user_1_gpt\" SESSION_ID_GPT = \"session_001_gpt\" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity # Create the specific session where the conversation will happen session_gpt = await session_service_gpt . create_session ( app_name = APP_NAME_GPT , user_id = USER_ID_GPT , session_id = SESSION_ID_GPT ) print ( f \"Session created: App='{APP_NAME_GPT}', User='{USER_ID_GPT}', Session='{SESSION_ID_GPT}'\" ) # Create a runner specific to this agent and its session service runner_gpt = Runner ( agent = weather_agent_gpt , app_name = APP_NAME_GPT , # Use the specific app name session_service = session_service_gpt # Use the specific session service ) print ( f \"Runner created for agent '{runner_gpt.agent.name}'.\" ) # --- Test the GPT Agent --- print ( \"\\n--- Testing GPT Agent ---\" ) # Ensure call_agent_async uses the correct runner , user_id , session_id await call_agent_async ( query = \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\" , runner = runner_gpt , user_id = USER_ID_GPT , session_id = SESSION_ID_GPT ) # --- OR --- # Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (. py file ) : # import asyncio # if __name__ == \"__main__\" : # try : # asyncio . run ( call_agent_async ( query = \"What's the weather in Tokyo?\" , # runner = runner_gpt , # user_id = USER_ID_GPT , # session_id = SESSION_ID_GPT ) # except Exception as e : # print ( f \"An error occurred: {e}\" ) except Exception as e : print ( f \"\u274c Could not create or run GPT agent '{MODEL_GPT_4O}'. Check API Key and model name. Error: {e}\" ) \ud83d\udccc First, let's create and test the agent using Anthropic's Claude Sonnet. # @title Define and Test Claude Agent # Make sure 'get_weather' function from Step 1 is defined in your environment . # Make sure 'call_agent_async' is defined from earlier . # --- Agent using Claude Sonnet --- weather_agent_claude = None # Initialize to None runner_claude = None # Initialize runner to None try : weather_agent_claude = Agent ( name = \"weather_agent_claude\" , # Key change : Wrap the LiteLLM model identifier model = LiteLlm ( model = MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET ), description = \"Provides weather information (using Claude Sonnet).\" , instruction = \"You are a helpful weather assistant powered by Claude Sonnet. \" \"Use the 'get_weather' tool for city weather requests. \" \"Analyze the tool's dictionary output ('status', 'report'/'error_message'). \" \"Clearly present successful reports or polite error messages.\" , tools =[ get_weather ] , # Re - use the same tool ) print ( f \"Agent '{weather_agent_claude.name}' created using model '{MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET}'.\" ) # InMemorySessionService is simple , non - persistent storage for this tutorial . session_service_claude = InMemorySessionService () # Create a dedicated service # Define constants for identifying the interaction context APP_NAME_CLAUDE = \"weather_tutorial_app_claude\" # Unique app name USER_ID_CLAUDE = \"user_1_claude\" SESSION_ID_CLAUDE = \"session_001_claude\" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity # Create the specific session where the conversation will happen session_claude = await session_service_claude . create_session ( app_name = APP_NAME_CLAUDE , user_id = USER_ID_CLAUDE , session_id = SESSION_ID_CLAUDE ) print ( f \"Session created: App='{APP_NAME_CLAUDE}', User='{USER_ID_CLAUDE}', Session='{SESSION_ID_CLAUDE}'\" ) # Create a runner specific to this agent and its session service runner_claude = Runner ( agent = weather_agent_claude , app_name = APP_NAME_CLAUDE , # Use the specific app name session_service = session_service_claude # Use the specific session service ) print ( f \"Runner created for agent '{runner_claude.agent.name}'.\" ) # --- Test the Claude Agent --- print ( \"\\n--- Testing Claude Agent ---\" ) # Ensure call_agent_async uses the correct runner , user_id , session_id await call_agent_async ( query = \"Weather in London please.\" , runner = runner_claude , user_id = USER_ID_CLAUDE , session_id = SESSION_ID_CLAUDE ) # --- OR --- # Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (. py file ) : # import asyncio # if __name__ == \"__main__\" : # try : # asyncio . run ( call_agent_async ( query = \"Weather in London please.\" , # runner = runner_claude , # user_id = USER_ID_CLAUDE , # session_id = SESSION_ID_CLAUDE ) # except Exception as e : # print ( f \"An error occurred: {e}\" ) except Exception as e : print ( f \"\u274c Could not create or run Claude agent '{MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET}'. Check API Key and model name. Error: {e}\" ) Each agent (weather_agent_gpt, weather_agent_claude) is created successfully (if API keys are valid). A dedicated session and runner are set up for each. Each agent correctly identifies the need to use the get_weather tool when processing the query (you'll see the --- Tool: get_weather called... --- log ). The underlying tool logic remains identical, always returning our mock data. However, the final textual response generated by each agent might differ slightly in phrasing, tone, or formatting. This is because the instruction prompt is interpreted and executed by different LLMs (GPT-4o vs. Claude Sonnet). \ud83d\udccc Building an Agent Team - Delegation for Greetings & Farewells. we built and experimented with a single agent focused solely on weather lookups. While effective for its specific task, real-world applications often involve handling a wider variety of user interactions. We could keep adding more tools and complex instructions to our single weather agent, but this can quickly become unmanageable and less efficient. A more robust approach is to build an Agent Team . This involves: Creating multiple, specialized agents , each designed for a specific capability (e.g., one for weather, one for greetings, one for calculations). Designating a root agent (or orchestrator ) that receives the initial user request. Enabling the root agent to delegate the request to the most appropriate specialized sub-agent based on the user's intent. \ud83d\udccc Why build an Agent Team? \u2705 Modularity: Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual agents. \u2705 Specialization: Each agent can be fine-tuned (instructions, model choice) for its specific task. \u2705 Scalability: Simpler to add new capabilities by adding new agents. \u2705 Efficiency: Allows using potentially simpler/cheaper models for simpler tasks (like greetings). Define simple tools for handling greetings ( say_hello ) and farewells ( say_goodbye ). Create two new specialized sub-agents: greeting_agent and farewell_agent . Update our main weather agent ( weather_agent_v2 ) to act as the root agent . Configure the root agent with its sub-agents, enabling automatic delegation . Test the delegation flow by sending different types of requests to the root agent. \ud83d\udccc Define Tools for Sub-Agents First, let's create the simple Python functions that will serve as tools for our new specialist agents. Remember, clear docstrings are vital for the agents that will use them. # @title Define Tools for Greeting and Farewell Agents from typing import Optional # Make sure to import Optional # Ensure 'get_weather' from Step 1 is available if running this step independently. # def get_weather(city: str) -> dict: ... (from Step 1) def say_hello ( name : Optional [ str ] = None ) -> str : \"\"\"Provides a simple greeting. If a name is provided, it will be used. Args: name (str, optional): The name of the person to greet. Defaults to a generic greeting if not provided. Returns: str: A friendly greeting message. \"\"\" if name : greeting = f \"Hello, { name } !\" print ( f \"--- Tool: say_hello called with name: { name } ---\" ) else : greeting = \"Hello there!\" # Default greeting if name is None or not explicitly passed print ( f \"--- Tool: say_hello called without a specific name (name_arg_value: { name } ) ---\" ) return greeting def say_goodbye () -> str : \"\"\"Provides a simple farewell message to conclude the conversation.\"\"\" print ( f \"--- Tool: say_goodbye called ---\" ) return \"Goodbye! Have a great day.\" print ( \"Greeting and Farewell tools defined.\" ) # Optional self-test print ( say_hello ( \"Alice\" )) print ( say_hello ()) # Test with no argument (should use default \"Hello there!\") print ( say_hello ( name = None )) # Test with name explicitly as None (should use default \"Hello there!\") \ud83d\udccc Define the Sub-Agents (Greeting & Farewell) Now, create the Agent instances for our specialists. Notice their highly focused instruction and, critically, their clear description. The description is the primary information the root agent uses to decide when to delegate to these sub-agents. Best Practice: Sub-agent description fields should accurately and concisely summarize their specific capability. This is crucial for effective automatic delegation. Best Practice: Sub-agent instruction fields should be tailored to their limited scope, telling them exactly what to do and what not to do (e.g., \"Your only task is...\"). # @title Define Greeting and Farewell Sub-Agents # If you want to use models other than Gemini, Ensure LiteLlm is imported and API keys are set (from Step 0/2) # from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm # MODEL_GPT_4O, MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET etc. should be defined # Or else, continue to use: model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH # --- Greeting Agent --- greeting_agent = None try : greeting_agent = Agent ( # Using a potentially different/cheaper model for a simple task model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH , # model=LiteLlm(model=MODEL_GPT_4O), # If you would like to experiment with other models name = \"greeting_agent\" , instruction = \"You are the Greeting Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a friendly greeting to the user. \" \"Use the 'say_hello' tool to generate the greeting. \" \"If the user provides their name, make sure to pass it to the tool. \" \"Do not engage in any other conversation or tasks.\" , description = \"Handles simple greetings and hellos using the 'say_hello' tool.\" , # Crucial for delegation tools = [ say_hello ], ) print ( f \"\u2705 Agent ' { greeting_agent . name } ' created using model ' { greeting_agent . model } '.\" ) except Exception as e : print ( f \"\u274c Could not create Greeting agent. Check API Key ( { greeting_agent . model } ). Error: { e } \" ) # --- Farewell Agent --- farewell_agent = None try : farewell_agent = Agent ( # Can use the same or a different model model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH , # model=LiteLlm(model=MODEL_GPT_4O), # If you would like to experiment with other models name = \"farewell_agent\" , instruction = \"You are the Farewell Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a polite goodbye message. \" \"Use the 'say_goodbye' tool when the user indicates they are leaving or ending the conversation \" \"(e.g., using words like 'bye', 'goodbye', 'thanks bye', 'see you'). \" \"Do not perform any other actions.\" , description = \"Handles simple farewells and goodbyes using the 'say_goodbye' tool.\" , # Crucial for delegation tools = [ say_goodbye ], ) print ( f \"\u2705 Agent ' { farewell_agent . name } ' created using model ' { farewell_agent . model } '.\" ) except Exception as e : print ( f \"\u274c Could not create Farewell agent. Check API Key ( { farewell_agent . model } ). Error: { e } \" ) \ud83d\udccc Define the Root Agent (Weather Agent v2) with Sub-Agents Adding the sub_agents parameter: We pass a list containing the greeting_agent and farewell_agent instances we just created. Updating the instruction: We explicitly tell the root agent about its sub-agents and when it should delegate tasks to them. \ud83d\udccc Key Concept: Automatic Delegation (Auto Flow) enables automatic delegation. When the root agent receives a user query, its LLM considers not only its own instructions and tools but also the description of each sub-agent. If the LLM determines that a query aligns better with a sub-agent's described capability (e.g., \"Handles simple greetings\"), it will automatically generate a special internal action to transfer control to that sub-agent for that turn. The sub-agent then processes the query using its own model, instructions, and tools. Best Practice: Ensure the root agent's instructions clearly guide its delegation decisions. Mention the sub-agents by name and describe the conditions under which delegation should occur. # @title Define the Root Agent with Sub - Agents # Ensure sub - agents were created successfully before defining the root agent . # Also ensure the original 'get_weather' tool is defined . root_agent = None runner_root = None # Initialize runner if greeting_agent and farewell_agent and 'get_weather' in globals () : # Let 's use a capable Gemini model for the root agent to handle orchestration root_agent_model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH weather_agent_team = Agent( name=\"weather_agent_v2\", # Give it a new version name model=root_agent_model, description=\"The main coordinator agent.

To create more sophisticated and context-aware experiences, agents need memory . ADK provides this through Session State . \ud83d\udccc What is Session State? It's a Python dictionary ( session.state ) tied to a specific user session (identified by APP_NAME, USER_ID, SESSION_ID). It persists information across multiple conversational turns within that session. Agents and Tools can read from and write to this state, allowing them to remember details, adapt behavior, and personalize responses. \ud83d\udccc How Agents Interact with State: ToolContext (Primary Method): Tools can accept a ToolContext object (automatically provided by ADK if declared as the last argument). This object gives direct access to the session state via tool_context.state , allowing tools to read preferences or save results during execution. output_key (Auto-Save Agent Response): An Agent can be configured with an output_key=\"your_key\" . ADK will then automatically save the agent's final textual response for a turn into session.state[\"your_key\"] . \ud83d\udccc Initialize New Session Service and State To clearly demonstrate state management without interference from prior steps, we'll instantiate a new InMemorySessionService. We'll also create a session with an initial state defining the user's preferred temperature unit. # @title 1. Initialize New Session Service and State # Import necessary session components from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService # Create a NEW session service instance for this state demonstration session_service_stateful = InMemorySessionService () print ( \"\u2705 New InMemorySessionService created for state demonstration.\" ) # Define a NEW session ID for this part of the tutorial SESSION_ID_STATEFUL = \"session_state_demo_001\" USER_ID_STATEFUL = \"user_state_demo\" # Define initial state data - user prefers Celsius initially initial_state = { \"user_preference_temperature_unit\" : \"Celsius\" } # Create the session, providing the initial state session_stateful = await session_service_stateful . create_session ( app_name = APP_NAME , # Use the consistent app name user_id = USER_ID_STATEFUL , session_id = SESSION_ID_STATEFUL , state = initial_state # <<< Initialize state during creation ) print ( f \"\u2705 Session ' { SESSION_ID_STATEFUL } ' created for user ' { USER_ID_STATEFUL } '.\" ) # Verify the initial state was set correctly retrieved_session = await session_service_stateful . get_session ( app_name = APP_NAME , user_id = USER_ID_STATEFUL , session_id = SESSION_ID_STATEFUL ) print ( \" \\n --- Initial Session State ---\" ) if retrieved_session : print ( retrieved_session . state ) else : print ( \"Error: Could not retrieve session.\" ) \ud83d\udccc Create State-Aware Weather Tool (get_weather_stateful) Now, we create a new version of the weather tool. Its key feature is accepting tool_context: ToolContext which allows it to access tool_context.state . It will read the user_preference_temperature_unit and format the temperature accordingly. Key Concept: ToolContext This object is the bridge allowing your tool logic to interact with the session's context, including reading and writing state variables. ADK injects it automatically if defined as the last parameter of your tool function. Best Practice: When reading from state, use dictionary.get('key', default_value) to handle cases where the key might not exist yet, ensuring your tool doesn't crash. from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext def get_weather_stateful ( city : str , tool_context : ToolContext ) -> dict : \"\"\"Retrieves weather, converts temp unit based on session state.\"\"\" print ( f \"--- Tool: get_weather_stateful called for { city } ---\" ) # --- Read preference from state --- preferred_unit = tool_context . state . get ( \"user_preference_temperature_unit\" , \"Celsius\" ) # Default to Celsius print ( f \"--- Tool: Reading state 'user_preference_temperature_unit': { preferred_unit } ---\" ) city_normalized = city . lower () . replace ( \" \" , \"\" ) # Mock weather data (always stored in Celsius internally) mock_weather_db = { \"newyork\" : { \"temp_c\" : 25 , \"condition\" : \"sunny\" }, \"london\" : { \"temp_c\" : 15 , \"condition\" : \"cloudy\" }, \"tokyo\" : { \"temp_c\" : 18 , \"condition\" : \"light rain\" }, } if city_normalized in mock_weather_db : data = mock_weather_db [ city_normalized ] temp_c = data [ \"temp_c\" ] condition = data [ \"condition\" ] # Format temperature based on state preference if preferred_unit == \"Fahrenheit\" : temp_value = ( temp_c * 9 / 5 ) + 32 # Calculate Fahrenheit temp_unit = \"\u00b0F\" else : # Default to Celsius temp_value = temp_c temp_unit = \"\u00b0C\" report = f \"The weather in { city . capitalize () } is { condition } with a temperature of { temp_value : .0f }{ temp_unit } .\" result = { \"status\" : \"success\" , \"report\" : report } print ( f \"--- Tool: Generated report in { preferred_unit } .

Then, we define our new root agent (weather_agent_v4_stateful): It uses the new get_weather_stateful tool. It includes the greeting and farewell sub-agents for delegation. Crucially , it sets output_key=\"last_weather_report\" which automatically saves its final weather response to the session state. # @title 3.

We'll use the call_agent_async function defined earlier, ensuring we pass the correct runner, user ID (USER_ID_STATEFUL), and session ID (SESSION_ID_STATEFUL). The conversation flow will be: Check weather (London) response (the weather report in Celsius) should get saved to state['last_weather_report'] via the output_key configuration. Manually update state: We will directly modify the state stored within the InMemorySessionService instance ( session_service_stateful ). Why direct modification? The session_service.get_session() method returns a copy of the session. Modifying that copy wouldn't affect the state used in subsequent agent runs. For this testing scenario with InMemorySessionService, we access the internal sessions dictionary to change the actual stored state value for user_preference_temperature_unit to \"Fahrenheit\". Note: In real applications, state changes are typically triggered by tools or agent logic returning EventActions(state_delta=...), not direct manual updates. Check weather again (New York): The get_weather_stateful tool should now read the updated \"Fahrenheit\" preference from the state and convert the temperature accordingly. The root agent's new response (weather in Fahrenheit) will overwrite the previous value in state['last_weather_report'] due to the output_key. Greet the agent: Verify that delegation to the greeting_agent still works correctly alongside the stateful operations. This interaction will become the last response saved by output_key in this specific sequence. Inspect final state: After the conversation, we retrieve the session one last time (getting a copy) and print its state to confirm the user_preference_temperature_unit is indeed \"Fahrenheit\", observe the final value saved by output_key (which will be the greeting in this run), and see the last_city_checked_stateful value written by the tool. # @title 4.

Stateful root agent runner ('runner_root_stateful') is not available.\" ) State Read: The weather tool ( get_weather_stateful ) correctly read user_preference_temperature_unit from state, initially using \"Celsius\" for London. State Update: The direct modification successfully changed the stored preference to \"Fahrenheit\". State Read (Updated): The tool subsequently read \"Fahrenheit\" when asked for New York's weather and performed the conversion. Tool State Write: The tool successfully wrote the last_city_checked_stateful (\"New York\" after the second weather check) into the state via tool_context.state. Delegation: The delegation to the greeting_agent for \"Hi!\" functioned correctly even after state modifications. output_key: The output_key=\"last_weather_report\" successfully saved the root agent's final response for each turn where the root agent was the one ultimately responding. In this sequence, the last response was the greeting (\"Hello, there!\"), so that overwrote the weather report in the state key. Final State: The final check confirms the preference persisted as \"Fahrenheit\". You've now successfully integrated session state to personalize agent behavior using ToolContext, manually manipulated state for testing InMemorySessionService, and observed how output_key provides a simple mechanism for saving the agent's last response to state. This foundational understanding of state management is key as we proceed to implement safety guardrails using callbacks in the next steps. \ud83d\udccc Adding Safety - Input Guardrail with before_model_callback Our agent team is becoming more capable, remembering preferences and using tools effectively. However, in real-world scenarios, we often need safety mechanisms to control the agent's behavior before potentially problematic requests even reach the core Large Language Model (LLM). ADK provides Callbacks \u2013 functions that allow you to hook into specific points in the agent's execution lifecycle. The before_model_callback is particularly useful for input safety. \ud83d\udccc What is before_model_callback? It's a Python function you define that ADK executes just before an agent sends its compiled request (including conversation history, instructions, and the latest user message) to the underlying LLM. Purpose: Inspect the request, modify it if necessary, or block it entirely based on predefined rules. \ud83d\udccc Common Use Cases: Input Validation/Filtering: Check if user input meets criteria or contains disallowed content (like PII or keywords). Guardrails: Prevent harmful, off-topic, or policy-violating requests from being processed by the LLM. Dynamic Prompt Modification: Add timely information (e.g., from session state) to the LLM request context just before sending. \ud83d\udccc How it Works: Define a function accepting callback_context: CallbackContext and llm_request: LlmRequest . callback_context: Provides access to agent info, session state (callback_context.state) , etc. llm_request: Contains the full payload intended for the LLM (contents, config) . Inside the function: Inspect: Examine llm_request.contents (especially the last user message). Modify (Use Caution): You can change parts of llm_request. Block (Guardrail): Return an LlmResponse object. ADK will send this response back immediately, skipping the LLM call for that turn. Allow: Return None . ADK proceeds to call the LLM with the (potentially modified) request. In this step, we will: Define a before_model_callback function ( block_keyword_guardrail ) that checks the user's input for a specific keyword (\"BLOCK\"). Update our stateful root agent ( weather_agent_v4_stateful from Step 4) to use this callback. Create a new runner associated with this updated agent but using the same stateful session service to maintain state continuity. Test the guardrail by sending both normal and keyword-containing requests. \ud83d\udccc Define the Guardrail Callback Function: This function will inspect the last user message within the llm_request content. If it finds \"BLOCK\" (case-insensitive), it constructs and returns an LlmResponse to block the flow; otherwise, it returns None. # @title 1. Define the before_model_callback Guardrail # Ensure necessary imports are available from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext from google.adk.models.llm_request import LlmRequest from google.adk.models.llm_response import LlmResponse from google.genai import types # For creating response content from typing import Optional def block_keyword_guardrail ( callback_context : CallbackContext , llm_request : LlmRequest ) -> Optional [ LlmResponse ]: \"\"\" Inspects the latest user message for 'BLOCK'.

We'll give it a new version name for clarity. Important: We need to redefine the sub-agents ( greeting_agent, farewell_agent ) and the stateful tool ( get_weather_stateful ) within this context if they are not already available from previous steps, ensuring the root agent definition has access to all its components. # @title 2.

Runner ('runner_root_model_guardrail') is not available.\" ) \ud83d\udccc Observe the execution flow: London Weather: The callback runs for weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail , inspects the message, prints \"Keyword not found. Allowing LLM call.\", and returns None . The agent proceeds, calls the get_weather_stateful tool (which uses the \"Fahrenheit\" preference from Step 4's state change), and returns the weather. This response updates last_weather_report via output_key . BLOCK Request: The callback runs again for weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail , inspects the message, finds \"BLOCK\", prints \"Blocking LLM call!\", sets the state flag, and returns the predefined LlmResponse. The agent's underlying LLM is never called for this turn. The user sees the callback's blocking message. Hello Again: The callback runs for weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail, allows the request. The root agent then delegates to greeting_agent. Note: The before_model_callback defined on the root agent does NOT automatically apply to sub-agents. The greeting_agent proceeds normally, calls its say_hello tool, and returns the greeting. You have successfully implemented an input safety layer! The before_model_callback provides a powerful mechanism to enforce rules and control agent behavior before expensive or potentially risky LLM calls are made. Next, we'll apply a similar concept to add guardrails around tool usage itself. \ud83d\udccc Adding Safety - Tool Argument Guardrail (before_tool_callback): In Step 5, we added a guardrail to inspect and potentially block user input before it reached the LLM. Now, we'll add another layer of control after the LLM has decided to use a tool but before that tool actually executes. This is useful for validating the arguments the LLM wants to pass to the tool. ADK provides the before_tool_callback for this precise purpose. \ud83d\udccc What is before_tool_callback? It's a Python function executed just before a specific tool function runs, after the LLM has requested its use and decided on the arguments. Purpose: Validate tool arguments, prevent tool execution based on specific inputs, modify arguments dynamically, or enforce resource usage policies. \ud83d\udccc Common Use Cases: Argument Validation: Check if arguments provided by the LLM are valid, within allowed ranges, or conform to expected formats. Resource Protection: Prevent tools from being called with inputs that might be costly, access restricted data, or cause unwanted side effects (e.g., blocking API calls for certain parameters). Dynamic Argument Modification: Adjust arguments based on session state or other contextual information before the tool runs. How it Works: Define a function accepting tool: BaseTool , args: Dict[str, Any] , and tool_context: ToolContext . tool: The tool object about to be called (inspect tool.name ). args: The dictionary of arguments the LLM generated for the tool. tool_context: Provides access to session state (tool_context.state), agent info, etc. Inside the function: Inspect: Examine the tool.name and the args dictionary. Modify: Change values within the args dictionary directly. If you return None , the tool runs with these modified args. Block/Override (Guardrail): Return a dictionary . ADK treats this dictionary as the result of the tool call, completely skipping the execution of the original tool function. The dictionary should ideally match the expected return format of the tool it's blocking. Allow: Return None . ADK proceeds to execute the actual tool function with the (potentially modified) arguments. In this step, we will: Define a before_tool_callback function ( block_paris_tool_guardrail ) that specifically checks if the get_weather_stateful tool is called with the city \"Paris\". If \"Paris\" is detected, the callback will block the tool and return a custom error dictionary. Update our root agent ( weather_agent_v6_tool_guardrail ) to include both the before_model_callback and this new before_tool_callback . Create a new runner for this agent, using the same stateful session service. Test the flow by requesting weather for allowed cities and the blocked city (\"Paris\"). \ud83d\udccc Define the Tool Guardrail Callback Function This function targets the get_weather_stateful tool. It checks the city argument. If it's \"Paris\", it returns an error dictionary that looks like the tool's own error response. Otherwise, it allows the tool to run by returning None. # @title 1.

Clear instructions and docstrings are paramount. Runners & Session Services: The engine and memory management system that orchestrate agent execution and maintain conversational context. Delegation: Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent description is key for auto-flow. Session State (ToolContext, output_key): Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents. Callbacks (before_model, before_tool): Powerful hooks for implementing safety, validation, policy enforcement, and dynamic modifications before critical operations (LLM calls or tool execution). Flexibility (LiteLlm): ADK empowers you to choose the best LLM for the job, balancing performance, cost, and features. \ud83d\udccc ADK and enhance your application: Real Weather API: Replace the mock_weather_db in your get_weather tool with a call to a real weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI). More Complex State: Store more user preferences (e.g., preferred location, notification settings) or conversation summaries in the session state. Refine Delegation: Experiment with different root agent instructions or sub-agent descriptions to fine-tune the delegation logic. Could you add a \"forecast\" agent? Advanced Callbacks: Use after_model_callback to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM's response after it's generated. Use after_tool_callback to process or log the results returned by a tool. Implement before_agent_callback or after_agent_callback for agent-level entry/exit logic. Error Handling: Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool. Persistent Session Storage: Explore alternatives to InMemorySessionService for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL \u2013 requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations). Streaming UI: Integrate your agent team with a web framework (like FastAPI, as shown in the ADK Streaming Quickstart) to create a real-time chat interface.

And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications. There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports. SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements. Exercise # We will be using a database with data about some of Pixar's classic movies for most of our exercises. This first exercise will only involve the Movies table, and the default query below currently shows all the properties of each movie. Table: movies # id title director year length_minutes 1 Toy Story John Lasseter 1995 81 2 A Bug's Life John Lasseter 1998 95 3 Toy Story 2 John Lasseter 1999 93 4 Monsters, Inc. Pete Docter 2001 92 5 Finding Nemo Andrew Stanton 2003 107 6 The Incredibles Brad Bird 2004 116 7 Cars John Lasseter 2006 117 8 Ratatouille Brad Bird 2007 115 9 WALL-E Andrew Stanton 2008 104 10 Up Pete Docter 2009 101 11 Toy Story 3 Lee Unkrich 2010 103 12 Cars 2 John Lasseter 2011 120 13 Brave Brenda Chapman 2012 102 14 Monsters University Dan Scanlon 2013 110 1. Find the title of each film SELECT title FROM movies; 2. Find the director of each film SELECT director FROM movies; 3. Find the title and director of each film SELECT title,director FROM movies; 4. Find the title and year of each film SELECT title,year FROM movies; 5. Find all the information about each film SELECT * FROM movies; SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints Now we know how to select for specific columns of data from a table, but if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible. In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not. Select query with constraints SELECT column, another_column, \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE condition AND/OR another_condition AND/OR \u2026; Operator Condition SQL Example =, !=, <, <=, >, >= Standard numerical operators col_name != 4 BETWEEN \u2026 AND \u2026 Number is within range of two values col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5 NOT BETWEEN \u2026 AND \u2026 Number is not within range of two values col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 IN (\u2026) Number exists in a list col_name IN (2, 4, 6) NOT IN (\u2026) Number does not exist in a list col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5) Exercise # 1. Find the movie with a row id of 6 SELECT * FROM movies where id=6 2. Find the movies released in the years between 2000 and 2010 SELECT * FROM movies where year between 2000 and 2010; 3. Find the movies not released in the years between 2000 and 2010 SELECT * FROM movies where year not between 2000 and 2010; 4. Find the first 5 Pixar movies and their release year SELECT title,Year FROM movies where id<=5; SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below: Operator Condition Example = Case sensitive exact string comparison (single equals) col_name = \"abc\" != or <> Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison col_name != \"abcd\" LIKE Case insensitive exact string comparison col_name LIKE \"ABC\" NOT LIKE Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison col_name NOT LIKE \"ABCD\" % Matches any sequence of characters (used with LIKE/NOT LIKE) col_name LIKE \"%AT%\" (matches \"AT\", \"ATTIC\", \"CAT\", \"BATS\") _ Matches a single character (used with LIKE/NOT LIKE) col_name LIKE \"AN_\" (matches \"AND\", not \"AN\") IN (\u2026) String exists in a list col_name IN (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\") NOT IN (\u2026) String does not exist in a list col_name NOT IN (\"D\", \"E\", \"F\") Exercise # 1. Find all the Toy Story movies SELECT title FROM movies where title like 'Toy Story%' 2. Find all the movies directed by John Lasseter SELECT title FROM movies where director like 'John Lasseter%' 3. Find all the movies (and director) not directed by John Lasseter SELECT title,director FROM movies where director not like 'John Lasseter%' 4. Find all the WALL-* movies SELECT * FROM movies where title like 'WALL-%' SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be \u2013 take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword. Since the DISTINCT keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows, we will learn in a future lesson how to discard duplicates based on specific columns using grouping and the GROUP BY clause. Ordering results # To help with this, SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause. When an ORDER BY clause is specified, each row is sorted alpha-numerically based on the specified column's value. SELECT column, another_column, \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE condition(s) ORDER BY column ASC/DESC; Limiting results to a subset # Another clause which is commonly used with the ORDER BY clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about. The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from. SELECT column, another_column, \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE condition(s) ORDER BY column ASC/DESC LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset; Exercise # 1. List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates SELECT DISTINCT(director) FROM movies ORDER BY director 2. List the last four Pixar movies released (ordered from most recent to least) SELECT title,year FROM movies ORDER BY year desc LIMIT 4 3. List the first five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically SELECT title FROM movies ORDER BY title LIMIT 5 4. List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY title LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5 SQL Review: Simple SELECT Queries Table: north_american_cities # City Country Population Latitude Longitude Guadalajara Mexico 1,500,800 20.659699 -103.349609 Toronto Canada 2,795,060 43.653226 -79.383184 Houston United States 2,195,914 29.760427 -95.369803 New York United States 8,405,837 40.712784 -74.005941 Philadelphia United States 1,553,165 39.952584 -75.165222 Havana Cuba 2,106,146 23.054070 -82.345189 Mexico City Mexico 8,555,500 19.432608 -99.133208 Phoenix United States 1,513,367 33.448377 -112.074037 Los Angeles United States 3,884,307 34.052234 -118.243685 Ecatepec de Morelos Mexico 1,742,000 19.601841 -99.050674 Montreal Canada 1,717,767 45.501689 -73.567256 Chicago United States 2,718,782 41.878114 -87.629798 Exercise # 1. List all the Canadian cities and their populations SELECT city,population FROM north_american_cities where country = 'Canada'; 2. Order all the cities in the United States by their latitude from north to south SELECT city, latitude FROM north_american_cities WHERE country = 'United States' ORDER BY latitude DESC; 3. List all the cities west of Chicago, ordered from west to east SELECT city, longitude FROM north_american_cities WHERE longitude < -87.629798 ORDER BY longitude ASC; 4. List the two largest cities in Mexico (by population) SELECT city, population FROM north_american_cities WHERE country = 'Mexico' ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 2; 5. List the third and fourth largest cities (by population) in the United States and their population SELECT city, population FROM north_american_cities WHERE country = 'United States' ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2; SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs Database normalization # Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car). As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, and performance issues can arise when working with many large tables. In order to answer questions about an entity that has data spanning multiple tables in a normalized database, we need to learn how to write a query that can combine all that data and pull out exactly the information we need. Multi-table queries with JOINs # Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database. One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique. Using the JOIN clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the INNER JOIN. SELECT column , another_table_column , \u2026 FROM mytable INNER JOIN another_table ON mytable . id = another_table . id WHERE condition ( s ) ORDER BY column , \u2026 ASC / DESC LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset ; The INNER JOIN is a process that matches rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by the ON constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables.

Find the domestic and international sales for each movie SELECT movies.title, boxoffice.domestic_sales, boxoffice.international_sales FROM movies JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id; 2. Show the sales numbers for each movie that did better internationally rather than domestically SELECT movies.title, boxoffice.domestic_sales, boxoffice.international_sales FROM movies JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id WHERE boxoffice.international_sales > boxoffice.domestic_sales; 3. List all the movies by their ratings in descending order SELECT movies.title, boxoffice.rating FROM movies JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id ORDER BY boxoffice.rating DESC; SQL Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs Depending on how you want to analyze the data, the INNER JOIN we used last lesson might not be sufficient because the resulting table only contains data that belongs in both of the tables. If the two tables have asymmetric data, which can easily happen when data is entered in different stages, then we would have to use a LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN instead to ensure that the data you need is not left out of the results. Select query with LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOINs on multiple tables # SELECT column, another_column, \u2026 FROM mytable INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id WHERE condition(s) ORDER BY column, \u2026 ASC/DESC LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset; Like the INNER JOIN these three new joins have to specify which column to join the data on. - When joining table A to table B, a LEFT JOIN simply includes rows from A regardless of whether a matching row is found in B. - The RIGHT JOIN is the same, but reversed, keeping rows in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. - Finally, a FULL JOIN simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table. Table: buildings (Read-only) # building_name capacity 1e 24 1w 32 2e 16 2w 20 Table: employees (Read-only) # role name building years_employed Engineer Becky A. 1e 4 Engineer Dan B. 1e 2 Engineer Sharon F. 1e 6 Engineer Dan M. 1e 4 Engineer Malcom S. 1e 1 Artist Tylar S. 2w 2 Artist Sherman D. 2w 8 Artist Jakob J. 2w 6 Artist Lillia A. 2w 7 Artist Brandon J. 2w 7 Manager Scott K. 1e 9 Manager Shirlee M. 1e 3 Manager Daria O. 2w 6 Exercise # 1. Find the list of all buildings that have employees SELECT DISTINCT building FROM employees; 2. Find the list of all buildings and their capacity SELECT * FROM buildings; 3. List all buildings and the distinct employee roles in each building (including empty buildings) SELECT b.building_name, e.role FROM buildings b LEFT JOIN employees e ON b.building_name = e.building GROUP BY b.building_name, e.role ORDER BY b.building_name, e.role; SQL Lesson 8: A short note on NULLs It's always good to reduce the possibility of NULL values in databases because they require special attention when constructing queries, constraints (certain functions behave differently with null values) and when processing the results. An alternative to NULL values in your database is to have data-type appropriate default values, like 0 for numerical data, empty strings for text data, etc. But if your database needs to store incomplete data, then NULL values can be appropriate if the default values will skew later analysis (for example, when taking averages of numerical data). Sometimes, it's also not possible to avoid NULL values, as we saw in the last lesson when outer-joining two tables with asymmetric data. In these cases, you can test a column for NULL values in a WHERE clause by using either the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL constraint. Select query with constraints on NULL values # SELECT column, another_column, \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE column IS/IS NOT NULL AND/OR another_condition AND/OR \u2026; Exercise # 1. Find the name and role of all employees who have not been assigned to a building SELECT name, role FROM employees WHERE building IS NULL OR building = ''; 2. Find the names of the buildings that hold no employees SELECT b.building_name FROM buildings b LEFT JOIN employees e ON b.building_name = e.building WHERE e.building IS NULL; SQL Lesson 9: Queries with expressions In addition to querying and referencing raw column data with SQL, you can also use expressions to write more complex logic on column values in a query. These expressions can use mathematical and string functions along with basic arithmetic to transform values when the query is executed, as shown in this physics example. Example query with expressions # SELECT particle_speed / 2.0 AS half_particle_speed FROM physics_data WHERE ABS(particle_position) * 10.0 > 500; Each database has its own supported set of mathematical, string, and date functions that can be used in a query, which you can find in their own respective docs. The use of expressions can save time and extra post-processing of the result data, but can also make the query harder to read, so we recommend that when expressions are used in the SELECT part of the query, that they are also given a descriptive alias using the AS keyword. Select query with expression aliases # SELECT col_expression AS expr_description, \u2026 FROM mytable; In addition to expressions, regular columns and even tables can also have aliases to make them easier to reference in the output and as a part of simplifying more complex queries. Example query with both column and table name aliases # SELECT column AS better_column_name, \u2026 FROM a_long_widgets_table_name AS mywidgets INNER JOIN widget_sales ON mywidgets.id = widget_sales.widget_id; Exercise # 1. List all movies and their combined sales in millions of dollars SELECT title, (domestic_sales + international_sales) / 1000000 AS gross_sales_millions FROM movies JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id; 2. List all movies and their ratings in percent SELECT title, rating * 10 AS rating_percent FROM movies JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id; 3. List all movies that were released on even number years SELECT title, year FROM movies WHERE year % 2 = 0; SQL Lesson 10: Queries with aggregates In addition to the simple expressions that we introduced last lesson, SQL also supports the use of aggregate expressions (or functions) that allow you to summarize information about a group of rows of data. With the Pixar database that you've been using, aggregate functions can be used to answer questions like, \"How many movies has Pixar produced?\", or \"What is the highest grossing Pixar film each year?\". Select query with aggregate functions over all rows # SELECT AGG_FUNC ( column_or_expression ) AS aggregate_description , \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE constraint_expression ; Without a specified grouping, each aggregate function is going to run on the whole set of result rows and return a single value. And like normal expressions, giving your aggregate functions an alias ensures that the results will be easier to read and process. Common aggregate functions # Here are some common aggregate functions that we are going to use in our examples: Function Description COUNT(*), COUNT(column) Counts the number of rows in the group if no column is specified; otherwise counts non-NULL values in the specified column. MIN(column) Finds the smallest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. MAX(column) Finds the largest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. AVG(column) Finds the average numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. SUM(column) Finds the sum of all numerical values in the specified column for the rows in the group. Grouped aggregate functions # In addition to aggregating across all the rows, you can instead apply the aggregate functions to individual groups of data within that group (ie. box office sales for Comedies vs Action movies). This would then create as many results as there are unique groups defined as by the GROUP BY clause. Select query with aggregate functions over groups # SELECT AGG_FUNC ( column_or_expression ) AS aggregate_description , \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE constraint_expression GROUP BY column ; The GROUP BY clause works by grouping rows that have the same value in the column specified. Select query with HAVING constraint # SELECT group_by_column , AGG_FUNC ( column_expression ) AS aggregate_result_alias , \u2026 FROM mytable WHERE condition GROUP BY column HAVING group_condition ; The HAVING clause constraints are written the same way as the WHERE clause constraints, and are applied to the grouped rows. With our examples, this might not seem like a particularly useful construct, but if you imagine data with millions of rows with different properties, being able to apply additional constraints is often necessary to quickly make sense of the data. Table: employees # role name building years_employed Engineer Becky A. 1e 4 Engineer Dan B. 1e 2 Engineer Sharon F. 1e 6 Engineer Dan M. 1e 4 Engineer Malcom S. 1e 1 Artist Tylar S. 2w 2 Artist Sherman D. 2w 8 Artist Jakob J. 2w 6 Artist Lillia A. 2w 7 Artist Brandon J. 2w 7 Manager Scott K. 1e 9 Manager Shirlee M. 1e 3 Manager Daria O. 2w 6 Exercise # 1. Find the longest time that an employee has been at the studio SELECT MAX(years_employed) AS longest_time FROM employees; 2. For each role, find the average number of years employed by employees in that role SELECT role, AVG(years_employed) as Average_years_employed FROM employees GROUP BY role; 3. Find the total number of employee years worked in each building SELECT building, SUM(years_employed) as Total_years_employed FROM employees GROUP BY building; 4. Find the number of Artists in the studio (without a HAVING clause) SELECT role, COUNT(*) as Number_of_artists FROM employees WHERE role = \"Artist\"; 5. Find the number of Employees of each role in the studio SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY role; 6. Find the total number of years employed by all Engineers SELECT role, SUM(years_employed) FROM employees GROUP BY role HAVING role = \"Engineer\"; SQL Lesson 11: Order of execution of a Query Now that we have an idea of all the parts of a query, we can now talk about how they all fit together in the context of a complete query. Complete SELECT query # SELECT DISTINCT column , AGG_FUNC ( column_or_expression ), \u2026 FROM mytable JOIN another_table ON mytable . column = another_table . column WHERE constraint_expression GROUP BY column HAVING constraint_expression ORDER BY column ASC / DESC LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT ; Query order of execution # `FROM and JOINs WHERE GROUP BY HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY LIMIT / OFFSET Table: movies (Read-only) # id title director year length_minutes 1 Toy Story John Lasseter 1995 81 2 A Bug's Life John Lasseter 1998 95 3 Toy Story 2 John Lasseter 1999 93 4 Monsters, Inc.

Find the total domestic and international sales that can be attributed to each director SELECT director, SUM(domestic_sales + international_sales) as Cumulative_sales_from_all_movies FROM movies INNER JOIN boxoffice ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id GROUP BY director; SQL Lesson 12: Creating tables When you have new entities and relationships to store in your database, you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement. Create table statement w/ optional table constraint and default value # CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable ( column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value, another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value, \u2026 ); Table data types # Different databases support different data types, but the common types support numeric, string, and other miscellaneous things like dates, booleans, or even binary data. Here are some examples that you might use in real code. Data Type Description INTEGER, BOOLEAN Store whole integer values like counts or ages. Boolean may be represented as 0 or 1. FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL Store precise numerical data with fractional values; different types indicate different floating point precisions. CHARACTER(num_chars) Fixed-length text data type that stores a specific number of characters; may truncate longer values. VARCHAR(num_chars) Variable-length text data type with a max character limit; more efficient for large tables than fixed-length types. TEXT Stores strings and text of varying length, typically without a specified max length. DATE, DATETIME Store date and time stamps; useful for time series and event data, but can be complex with timezones. BLOB Stores binary large objects (binary data); opaque to database, requiring proper metadata for retrieval. Table constraints # We aren't going to dive too deep into table constraints in this lesson, but each column can have additional table constraints on it which limit what values can be inserted into that column. This is not a comprehensive list, but will show a few common constraints that you might find useful. Constraint Description PRIMARY KEY Values in this column are unique and identify a single row in the table. AUTOINCREMENT Automatically fills and increments integer values with each row insertion (not supported in all databases). UNIQUE Values in this column must be unique, but unlike PRIMARY KEY, it does not necessarily identify a row. NOT NULL Values inserted in this column cannot be NULL. CHECK (expression) Validates values based on a condition/expression, e.g., ensuring positive values or specific formats. FOREIGN KEY Ensures that each value in this column corresponds to a valid value in another table\u2019s column, enforcing referential integrity. Movies table schema # CREATE TABLE movies ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, director TEXT, year INTEGER, length_minutes INTEGER ); Exercise # 1. Create a new table named Database with the following columns: \u2013 Name A string (text) describing the name of the database \u2013 Version A number (floating point) of the latest version of this database \u2013 Download_count An integer count of the number of times this database was downloaded - This table has no constraints. CREATE TABLE Database ( Name TEXT , Version FLOAT , Download_count INTEGER ); SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows What is a Schema? We previously described a table in a database as a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, with the columns being the properties and the rows being instances of the entity in the table. In SQL, the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain. Inserting new data # When inserting data into a database, we need to use an INSERT statement, which declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling, and one or more rows of data to insert. In general, each row of data you insert should contain values for every corresponding column in the table. You can insert multiple rows at a time by just listing them sequentially. Insert statement with values for all columns # INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, \u2026), (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, \u2026), \u2026; Exercise # 1. Add the studio's new production, Toy Story 4 to the list of movies (you can use any director) INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, \"Toy Story 4\", \"El Directore\", 2015, 90); 2. Toy Story 4 has been released to critical acclaim! It had a rating of 8.7, and made 340 million domestically and 270 million internationally. Add the record to the BoxOffice table. INSERT INTO boxoffice VALUES (4, 8.7, 340000000, 270000000); SQL Lesson 13: Updating rows In addition to adding new data, a common task is to update existing data, which can be done using an UPDATE statement. Similar to the INSERT statement, you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update. In addition, the data you are updating has to match the data type of the columns in the table schema. Update statement with values # UPDATE mytable SET column = value_or_expr, other_column = another_value_or_expr, \u2026 WHERE condition; Exercise # 1. The director for A Bug's Life is incorrect, it was actually directed by John Lasseter UPDATE movies SET director = \"John Lasseter\" WHERE id = 2; 2. The year that Toy Story 2 was released is incorrect, it was actually released in 1999 UPDATE movies SET year = 1999 WHERE id = 3; 3. Both the title and director for Toy Story 8 is incorrect! The title should be \"Toy Story 3\" and it was directed by Lee Unkrich UPDATE movies SET title = \"Toy Story 3\", director = \"Lee Unkrich\" WHERE id = 11; SQL Lesson 14: Deleting rows When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause. Delete statement with condition # DELETE FROM mytable WHERE condition; If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional). Taking extra care # Like the UPDATE statement from last lesson, it's recommended that you run the constraint in a SELECT query first to ensure that you are removing the right rows. Without a proper backup or test database, it is downright easy to irrevocably remove data, so always read your DELETE statements twice and execute once. Exercise # 1. This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005. DELETE FROM movies where year < 2005; 2. Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him. DELETE FROM movies where director = \"Andrew Stanton\"; SQL Lesson 15: Altering tables As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints. Adding columns # The syntax for adding a new column is similar to the syntax when creating new rows in the CREATE TABLE statement. You need to specify the data type of the column along with any potential table constraints and default values to be applied to both existing and new rows. In some databases like MySQL, you can even specify where to insert the new column using the FIRST or AFTER clauses, though this is not a standard feature. Altering table to add new column(s) # ALTER TABLE mytable ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint DEFAULT default_value; Removing columns # Dropping columns is as easy as specifying the column to drop, however, some databases (including SQLite) don't support this feature. Instead you may have to create a new table and migrate the data over. Altering table to remove column(s) # ALTER TABLE mytable DROP column_to_be_deleted; Renaming the table # If you need to rename the table itself, you can also do that using the RENAME TO clause of the statement. Altering table name # ALTER TABLE mytable RENAME TO new_table_name; Exercise # 1. Add a column named Aspect_ratio with a FLOAT data type to store the aspect-ratio each movie was released in. ALTER TABLE Movies ADD COLUMN Aspect_ratio FLOAT DEFAULT 2.39; 2. Add another column named Language with a TEXT data type to store the language that the movie was released in. Ensure that the default for this language is English. ALTER TABLE Movies ADD COLUMN Language TEXT DEFAULT \"English\"; SQL Lesson 16: Dropping tables In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the DROP TABLE statement, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely. Drop table statement # DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable ; Like the CREATE TABLE statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the IF EXISTS clause. In addition, if you have another table that is dependent on columns in table you are removing (for example, with a FOREIGN KEY dependency) then you will have to either update all dependent tables first to remove the dependent rows or to remove those tables entirely. Exercise # 1. We've sadly reached the end of our lessons, lets clean up by removing the Movies table DROP TABLE Movies; 2. And drop the BoxOffice table as well DROP TABLE BoxOffice;","title":"Basic SQL"},{"location":"Data-processing/sql.html#introduction-to-sql","text":"","title":"Introduction to SQL"},{"location":"Data-processing/sql.html#what-is-sql","text":"SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

CHARACTER(num_chars) Fixed-length text data type that stores a specific number of characters; may truncate longer values. VARCHAR(num_chars) Variable-length text data type with a max character limit; more efficient for large tables than fixed-length types. TEXT Stores strings and text of varying length, typically without a specified max length. DATE, DATETIME Store date and time stamps; useful for time series and event data, but can be complex with timezones. BLOB Stores binary large objects (binary data); opaque to database, requiring proper metadata for retrieval.","title":"Table data types"},{"location":"Data-processing/sql.html#table-constraints","text":"We aren't going to dive too deep into table constraints in this lesson, but each column can have additional table constraints on it which limit what values can be inserted into that column.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses algorithms called artificial neural networks , inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning is particularly powerful when working with unstructured data like images, audio, text, or videos. The \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the number of layers in these neural networks. A neural network is composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) . A deep neural network has many hidden layers between the input and output layers, allowing it to learn and represent data at various levels of abstraction. \ud83d\udccc Key Concepts Neural Networks A neural network is made up of layers of nodes (neurons): Input layer (where data is fed) Hidden layers (where computation happens) Output layer (where the result is produced) Deep Neural Networks (DNN) A \"deep\" network has multiple hidden layers . These allow it to learn complex patterns . Common Deep Learning Architectures: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) \u2013 for images RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) \u2013 for sequences, e.g., text Transformers \u2013 modern architectures used in NLP (like ChatGPT) \ud83d\udccc What is a Neural Network? Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. These models consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making. \ud83d\udccc Understanding Neural Networks in Deep Learning Neural networks are capable of learning and identifying patterns directly from data without pre-defined rules. These networks are built from several key components: Neurons: The basic units that receive inputs, each neuron is governed by a threshold and an activation function. Connections: Links between neurons that carry information, regulated by weights and biases. Weights and Biases: These parameters determine the strength and influence of connections. Propagation Functions: Mechanisms that help process and transfer data across layers of neurons. Learning Rule: The method that adjusts weights and biases over time to improve accuracy. \ud83d\udccc Neural networks follows a structured, three-stage process: Input Computation: Data is fed into the network. Output Generation: Based on the current parameters, the network generates an output. Iterative Refinement: The network refines its output by adjusting weights and biases, gradually improving its performance on diverse tasks. \ud83d\udccc In an adaptive learning environment: The neural network is exposed to a simulated scenario or dataset. Parameters such as weights and biases are updated in response to new data or conditions. With each adjustment, the network\u2019s response evolves allowing it to adapt effectively to different tasks or environments. \ud83d\udccc Layers in Neural Network Architecture: \ud83d\udccc What is Forward Propagation? When data is input into the network, it passes through the network in the forward direction, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. This process is known as forward propagation. Here\u2019s what happens during this phase: 1. Linear Transformation: Each neuron in a layer receives inputs which are multiplied by the weights associated with the connections. These products are summed together and a bias is added to the sum. This can be represented mathematically as: where w represents the weights x represents the inputs b is the bias 2. Activation: The result of the linear transformation (denoted as z) is then passed through an activation function. The activation function is crucial because it introduces non-linearity into the system, enabling the network to learn more complex patterns. Popular activation functions include ReLU , sigmoid and tanh . Forward Propagation is the process of passing input data through the neural network layer-by-layer to get an output (or prediction). Computing weighted sums Applying activation functions Passing the output to the next layer, until reaching the final prediction It's like feeding data forward through the network. \ud83d\uded2 Real-Time Example: Predicting Purchase Decision in E-Commerce Imagine you're building a model to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not, based on: Feature Value Time on website 10 minutes Pages visited 5 Previous purchases 2 Feed this input into a small neural network to predict: Buy (1) or Not Buy (0) . \ud83e\udde0 Neural Network Structure Let\u2019s say your network looks like this: Input Layer: 3 neurons (for 3 input features) Hidden Layer: 2 neurons Output Layer: 1 neuron (Buy or Not) Input \u2192 [Hidden1, Hidden2] \u2192 Output \u2797 Step-by-Step Forward Propagation \ud83c\udfaf Inputs x = [10, 5, 2] # Time, Pages, Purchases \ud83d\udd17 Weights (Randomly initialized) Hidden Layer weights: w1 = [[ 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 1 ], # Weights for Hidden1 [ 0 . 5 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 2 ]] # Weights for Hidden2 Output Layer weights: w2 = [0.6, 0.9] # Weights from Hidden1 and Hidden2 to Output \ud83d\udcc8 Step 1: Input \u2192 Hidden Layer For Hidden1: z1 = 10*0.2 + 5*0.4 + 2*0.1 = 2 + 2 + 0.2 = 4.2 a1 = sigmoid(4.2) \u2248 0.985 For Hidden2: z2 = 10*0.5 + 5*0.3 + 2*0.2 = 5 + 1.5 + 0.4 = 6.9 a2 = sigmoid(6.9) \u2248 0.999 Now, hidden layer outputs: hidden_output = [0.985, 0.999] \ud83e\uddee Step 2: Hidden \u2192 Output z3 = 0.985*0.6 + 0.999*0.9 = 0.591 + 0.899 = 1.49 a3 = sigmoid(1.49) \u2248 0.816 \u2705 Final Prediction: 0.816 This means: There's an 81.6% chance that the customer will buy the product. \ud83e\udde0 Summary Step Layer Formula Value 1 Hidden1 z = x\u00b7w + b \u2192 sigmoid(z) 0.985 2 Hidden2 same as above 0.999 3 Output z = hidden\u00b7w + b \u2192 sigmoid(z) 0.816 \ud83d\udccc Why It Matters Forward propagation is how the neural network generates predictions before learning. Once predictions are made, we compare them to the actual result, and then backpropagation is used to update weights to improve future predictions. Simple Python example using NumPy: import numpy as np def sigmoid ( x ): return 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - x )) # Inputs x = np . array ([ 10 , 5 , 2 ]) # Weights w1 = np . array ([[ 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.1 ], [ 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.2 ]]) w2 = np . array ([ 0.6 , 0.9 ]) # Forward pass hidden_input = np . dot ( w1 , x ) hidden_output = sigmoid ( hidden_input ) final_input = np . dot ( w2 , hidden_output ) output = sigmoid ( final_input ) print ( f \"Final output (purchase probability): { output : .3f } \" ) Final output (purchase probability): 0.816 \ud83d\udccc What is Backpropagation? After forward propagation, the network evaluates its performance using a loss function which measures the difference between the actual output and the predicted output. The goal of training is to minimize this loss. This is where backpropagation comes into play: Loss Calculation: The network calculates the loss which provides a measure of error in the predictions. The loss function could vary; common choices are mean squared error for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification. Gradient Calculation: The network computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. This involves applying the chain rule of calculus to find out how much each part of the output error can be attributed to each weight and bias. Weight Update: Once the gradients are calculated, the weights and biases are updated using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The weights are adjusted in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. The size of the step taken in each update is determined by the learning rate. Backpropagation is the learning process in deep learning. After forward propagation (i.e., making a prediction), the model: Compares the predicted output to the actual value using a loss function Calculates how wrong the prediction was (the error) Moves backward through the network , adjusting the weights so that future predictions improve \ud83d\udc49 Forward propagation = prediction \ud83d\udc49 Backpropagation = learning \ud83d\udd01 Using the Same Example: E-Commerce Purchase Prediction \ud83e\udde0 Setup Recap Input: [10, 5, 2] Predicted output: 0.816 (from forward propagation) Actual output (label): 1 (customer actually bought) Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy \u2699\ufe0f Step-by-Step Backpropagation We use gradient descent to update the weights by calculating the gradient of the loss w.r.t. each weight. \ud83d\udd27 1. Compute Loss (Binary Cross Entropy) This is the error we want to minimize. \ud83d\udd04 2. Compute Gradients (Chain Rule) We use the chain rule of calculus to backpropagate the error. Let\u2019s focus on the output neuron and then the hidden layer. \ud83e\uddee a. Output Layer We calculate how much the output neuron contributed to the error. Let\u2019s denote: \ud83d\udd01 b. Hidden Layer We now calculate how the hidden neurons contributed to the output error. \ud83d\udd01 3. Update Weights \ud83d\udd04 This Process Repeats... In each epoch (training cycle), the network: Performs forward pass (predict) Calculates loss (compare with actual) Performs backward pass (update weights) Over many epochs , the network learns patterns and improves accuracy. \ud83c\udf93 Visualization Input \u2192 Hidden Layer \u2192 Output (forward) \u2190 Gradients \u2190 (backward) \u2705 Summary Stage What Happens Forward Prop Predict output Compare Calculate loss Backward Prop Compute gradients Update Adjust weights Here\u2019s a mini example in NumPy (gradient calculation): import numpy as np def sigmoid ( x ): return 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - x )) def sigmoid_deriv ( x ): return x * ( 1 - x ) # Input and label X = np . array ([[ 10 , 5 , 2 ]]) y = np . array ([[ 1 ]]) # Weights w1 = np . random . rand ( 3 , 2 ) w2 = np . random . rand ( 2 , 1 ) # Forward hidden_input = np . dot ( X , w1 ) hidden_output = sigmoid ( hidden_input ) final_input = np . dot ( hidden_output , w2 ) output = sigmoid ( final_input ) # Loss and backprop error = y - output d_output = error * sigmoid_deriv ( output ) d_hidden = d_output . dot ( w2 .

You can see the loss steadily decreases over time, which shows the model is learning and improving its predictions. \ud83d\udccc Iteration This process of forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation and weight update is repeated for many iterations over the dataset. Over time, this iterative process reduces the loss and the network's predictions become more accurate. Through these steps, neural networks can adapt their parameters to better approximate the relationships in the data, thereby improving their performance on tasks such as classification, regression or any other predictive modeling. \ud83d\udccc Example of Email Classification Let's consider a record of an email dataset: To classify this email, we will create a feature vector based on the analysis of keywords such as \"free\" \"win\" and \"offer\" The feature vector of the record can be presented as: \"free\": Present (1) \"win\": Absent (0) \"offer\": Present (1) \ud83d\udccc How Neurons Process Data in a Neural Network In a neural network, input data is passed through multiple layers, including one or more hidden layers. Each neuron in these hidden layers performs several operations, transforming the input into a usable output. Input Layer: The input layer contains 3 nodes that indicates the presence of each keyword. Hidden Layer: The input vector is passed through the hidden layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer performs two primary operations: a weighted sum followed by an activation function. Weights: Neuron H1: [0.5,\u22120.2,0.3] Neuron H2: [0.4,0.1,\u22120.5] Input Vector: [1,0,1] Weighted Sum Calculation For H1: (1\u00d70.5)+(0\u00d7\u22120.2)+(1\u00d70.3)=0.5+0+0.3=0.8 For H2: (1\u00d70.4)+(0\u00d70.1)+(1\u00d7\u22120.5)=0.4+0\u22120.5=\u22120.1 Activation Function Here we will use ReLu activation function : H1 Output: ReLU(0.8)= 0.8 H2 Output: ReLu(-0.1) = 0 3. Output Layer The activated values from the hidden neurons are sent to the output neuron where they are again processed using a weighted sum and an activation function. Output Weights: [0.7, 0.2] Input from Hidden Layer: [0.8, 0] Weighted Sum: (0.8\u00d70.7)+(0\u00d70.2)=0.56+0=0.56 Activation (Sigmoid): 4. Final Classification The output value of approximately 0.636 indicates the probability of the email being spam. Since this value is greater than 0.5, the neural network classifies the email as spam (1). \ud83d\udccc Learning of a Neural Network 1. Learning with Supervised Learning In supervised learning, a neural network learns from labeled input-output pairs provided by a teacher. The network generates outputs based on inputs and by comparing these outputs to the known desired outputs, an error signal is created. The network iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize errors until it reaches an acceptable performance level. 2. Learning with Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning involves data without labeled output variables. The primary goal is to understand the underlying structure of the input data (X). Unlike supervised learning, there is no instructor to guide the process. Instead, the focus is on modeling data patterns and relationships, with techniques like clustering and association commonly used. 3. Learning with Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning enables a neural network to learn through interaction with its environment. The network receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, guiding it to find an optimal policy or strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. This approach is widely used in applications like gaming and decision-making. \ud83d\udccc Types of Neural Networks \ud83e\udde0 1.

The vanishing gradient problem is a challenge that emerges during backpropagation when the derivatives or slopes of the activation functions become progressively smaller as we move backward through the layers of a neural network. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in deep networks with many layers, hindering the effective training of the model. The weight updates becomes extremely tiny, or even exponentially small, it can significantly prolong the training time, and in the worst-case scenario, it can halt the training process altogether. Why the Problem Occurs? During backpropagation, the gradients propagate back through the layers of the network, they decrease significantly. This means that as they leave the output layer and return to the input layer, the gradients become progressively smaller. As a result, the weights associated with the initial levels, which accommodate these small gradients, are updated little or not at each iteration of the optimization process. The vanishing gradient problem is particularly associated with the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation functions because their derivatives fall within the range of 0 to 0.25 and 0 to 1, respectively. Consequently, extreme weights becomes very small, causing the updated weights to closely resemble the original ones. This persistence of small updates contributes to the vanishing gradient issue. The sigmoid and tanh functions limit the input values \u200b\u200bto the ranges [0,1] and [-1,1], so that they saturate at 0 or 1 for sigmoid and -1 or 1 for Tanh. The derivatives at points becomes zero as they are moving. In these regions, especially when inputs are very small or large, the gradients are very close to zero. When training deep neural networks (especially RNNs, LSTMs, and deep feedforward networks), we use backpropagation to update weights. The update depends on gradients \u2014 numbers that tell us how much to change the weights. If these gradients become very small as they move backward through the layers, they can \u201cvanish\u201d (approach zero). When this happens: The earlier layers barely get updated . The network learns very slowly or stops learning . Why it Happens? In backpropagation, gradients are multiplied many times by the derivative of the activation function . For example: If the derivative is small (e.g., 0.1), multiplying it through 50 layers gives: Sigmoid and tanh activations squash numbers between small ranges, so their derivatives are small, which worsens the problem. Real-Life Example: The Whisper Game # Imagine a group of 50 people standing in a line. Person 1 whispers a message: \u201cThe train leaves at 8.\u201d Each person passes it on quietly to the next. By the time it reaches Person 50 , the message becomes: \u201cT...ain...8\u201d (almost lost). Why? Every person slightly loses information. The earlier the person , the more the message is lost before it reaches the end. This is the same as vanishing gradients: The \u201cmessage\u201d = gradient information. Passing through people = layers in the neural network. Whispering quietly = multiplying by small derivatives (like sigmoid output\u2019s slope). Impact on RNNs RNNs process sequences step by step (like passing the message from one person to the next). If gradients vanish, early time steps (earlier words in a sentence) get forgotten.

While building a neural network, one key decision is selecting the Activation Function for both the hidden layer and the output layer . It is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron It introduces non-linearity into the model , allowing the network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. Without this non-linearity feature a neural network would behave like a linear regression model no matter how many layers it has. Activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated by calculating the weighted sum of inputs and adding a bias term. 1. Weighted Sum of Inputs: In a neural network, each input to a neuron is multiplied by a weight. These weights represent the importance or strength of each input. Formula: 2. Adding Bias: The bias b is a value added to the weighted sum. It helps the neuron to shift the activation function curve to the left or right, allowing the model to better fit the data. What happens next? Intuition behind the sigmoid: It's a smooth curve that squashes any input value into a range between 0 and 1. Useful to interpret the output as a probability or \"activation level\". \ud83d\udccc Introducing Non-Linearity in Neural Network? Imagine you want to classify apples and bananas based on their shape and color. If we use a linear function it can only separate them using a straight line. But real-world data is often more complex like overlapping colors, different lighting, etc. By adding a non-linear activation function like ReLU, Sigmoid or Tanh the network can create curved decision boundaries to separate them correctly. Why is Non-Linearity Important in Neural Networks? Neural networks consist of neurons that operate using weights, biases and activation functions. In the learning process these weights and biases are updated based on the error produced at the output\u2014a process known as backpropagation. Activation functions enable backpropagation by providing gradients that are essential for updating the weights and biases. Without non-linearity even deep networks would be limited to solving only simple, linearly separable problems. Activation functions help neural networks to model highly complex data distributions and solve advanced deep learning tasks. Adding non-linear activation functions introduce flexibility and enable the network to learn more complex and abstract patterns from data. Mathematical Proof of Need of Non-Linearity in Neural Networks To illustrate the need for non-linearity in neural networks with a specific example let's consider a network with two input nodes (i1 and i2), a single hidden layer containing neurons h1 and h2 \u200b and an output neuron (out). Non-linearity means that the relationship between input and output is not a straight line. In simple terms the output does not change proportionally with the input. A common choice is the ReLU function defined as \u03c3(x)=max(0,x) . \u03c3(x)=max(0,x) is a mathematical function called the ReLU function , which stands for Rectified Linear Unit . Explanation: \u03c3(x) here is the function notation.The Greek letter \u03c3 (sigma) is just a symbol for the function;sometimes people use different symbols, but it just means a function of x. The function outputs the maximum value between 0 and the input x. What it means in simple terms: If x is positive or zero , then \u03c3(x)=x. If x is negative , then \u03c3(x)=0. Example: x sigma(x) = max(0, x) -3 0 0 0 2 2 5 5 Where is this used? In neural networks , ReLU is a popular activation function used in neurons to decide whether a neuron should \"fire\" or not, by transforming the input signal. Why use ReLU? It introduces non-linearity in the network. It is simple and fast to compute. Helps with the problem of vanishing gradients (compared to sigmoid or tanh). \ud83d\udccc Common activation functions used in neural networks and how ReLU compares to them. Activation Output Range Shape Pros Cons ReLU [0, \u221e) Piecewise linear (zero + line) Fast, simple, avoids vanishing gradient Can \"die\" (neurons output zero forever) for negative inputs Sigmoid (0, 1) Smooth S-shape Output interpretable as probability Vanishing gradient, slow training Tanh (-1, 1) Smooth S-shape centered at zero Zero-centered outputs Vanishing gradient, slower ReLU: Outputs zero for all negative values, then increases linearly for positive values. Sigmoid: Smooth S-shaped curve between 0 and 1, saturates at both ends. Tanh: Smooth S-shaped curve between -1 and 1, zero-centered. You can see how ReLU sharply cuts off negative values and grows linearly, which helps neural networks learn efficiently.","title":"Activation Functions"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/Backpropagation.html","text":"","title":"Backpropagation"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/ForwardPropagation.html","text":"","title":"Forward Propagation"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/LayersNeuralNetworks.html","text":"","title":"Layers in Neural Networks"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/LearningRate.html","text":"","title":"Learning Rate"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/LossFunctions.html","text":"","title":"Loss Functions"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Components/WeightsBiases.html","text":"","title":"Weights and Biases"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Autoencoders.html","text":"","title":"Autoencoders"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/BERT.html","text":"\u2705 BERT \ud83d\udccc What is BERT?

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an advanced version of artificial neural networks (ANNs), primarily designed to extract features from grid-like matrix datasets. This is particularly useful for visual datasets such as images or videos, where data patterns play a crucial role. CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications due to their effectiveness in processing visual data. CNNs consist of multiple layers like the input layer , Convolutional layer , pooling layer , and fully connected layers . \ud83d\udccc How Convolutional Layers Works? Convolution Neural Networks are neural networks that share their parameters. Imagine you have an image. It can be represented as a cuboid having its length, width (dimension of the image), and height (i.e the channel as images generally have red, green, and blue channels). Now imagine taking a small patch of this image and running a small neural network, called a filter or kernel on it, with say, K outputs and representing them vertically. Now slide that neural network across the whole image, as a result, we will get another image with different widths, heights, and depths. Instead of just R, G, and B channels now we have more channels but lesser width and height. This operation is called Convolution. If the patch size is the same as that of the image it will be a regular neural network. Because of this small patch, we have fewer weights. \ud83d\udccc Mathematical Overview of Convolution Convolution layers consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels) having small widths and heights and the same depth as that of input volume (3 if the input layer is image input). For example, if we have to run convolution on an image with dimensions 34x34x3. The possible size of filters can be axax3, where \u2018a\u2019 can be anything like 3, 5, or 7 but smaller as compared to the image dimension. During the forward pass, we slide each filter across the whole input volume step by step where each step is called stride (which can have a value of 2, 3, or even 4 for high-dimensional images) and compute the dot product between the kernel weights and patch from input volume. As we slide our filters we\u2019ll get a 2-D output for each filter and we\u2019ll stack them together as a result, we\u2019ll get output volume having a depth equal to the number of filters. The network will learn all the filters. x","title":"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/ComputerVision.html","text":"\u2705 Computer Vision \ud83d\udccc What is Computer Vision? Computer Vision (CV) in artificial intelligence (AI) help machines to interpret and understand visual information similar to how humans use their eyes and brains. It involves teaching computers to analyze and understand images and videos, helping them \"see\" the world. From identifying objects in images to recognizing faces in a crowd, it is revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, automotive, security and entertainment. \ud83d\udccc Key Concepts of Computer Vision Image Processing: This involves improving or changing an image to make it clearer or easier to analyze. It includes cleaning up images by removing noise, improving contrast or adjusting the lighting. Object Detection: This allows the machine to find and identify specific objects within an image or video. For example, it can detect faces in a photo or find cars in a traffic scene. Image Classification: It involves categorizing an image into a specific class or label such as identifying whether a given image is of a dog or a cat. Feature Extraction: It is the process of identifying unique patterns or features in an image that can be used for further analysis like shapes, colors or textures. \ud83d\udccc How Does Computer Vision Work? Image Acquisition: It involves collecting images or videos using cameras, sensors or other devices. The quality of the image and its type (black-and-white, color or 3D) affects how the system will process the data. Preprocessing: Raw images are often not perfect, so they are cleaned up first. This might include adjusting the brightness, sharpening the image or removing unwanted noise to help the system see better. Feature Detection: In this, the system looks for key elements in the image like edges, patterns or shapes. This helps the system focus on the important parts of the image. Pattern Recognition: This compares what it detects in the image to known patterns or examples. Using machine learning, the system can recognize objects, classify images or even understand relationships in the image. Decision Making: After recognizing patterns, the system uses this information to make decisions such as identifying a dog in the image or recognizing a stop sign in a video. \ud83d\udccc Tasks of Computer Vision Object Recognition: This is used for identifying objects in an image such as recognizing a car, dog or tree. It\u2019s used in surveillance, self-driving cars and checking products in factories. Face Recognition: This involves identifying people based on their facial features. It is used in security systems, unlocking smartphones and identifying people in photos or videos. Image Segmentation: Segmentation breaks an image into smaller parts for easier analysis. For example, in medical imaging, different organs may be segmented to focus on specific areas. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): OCR helps in recognizing text in images such as scanning documents or extracting text from pictures of signs. It\u2019s used in document scanners, translation apps and more. \ud83d\udccc Key Techniques in Computer Vision Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of deep learning model that has changed the field of CV.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an enhanced version of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data making them ideal for tasks like language translation, speech recognition and time series forecasting. Unlike traditional RNNs which use a single hidden state passed through time LSTMs introduce a memory cell that holds information over extended periods addressing the challenge of learning long-term dependencies. Problem with Long-Term Dependencies in RNN Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. \ud83d\udccc Understanding LSTM Networks Long Short Term Memory networks \u2013 usually just called \u201cLSTMs\u201d \u2013 are a special kind of RNN,capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn! All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer. The repeating module in a standard RNN contains a single layer. LSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure. Instead of having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way. The Core Idea Behind LSTMs # The key to LSTMs is the cell state, the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram. The cell state is kind of like a conveyor belt. It runs straight down the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions. It\u2019s very easy for information to just flow along it unchanged. Memory Cell # You can Add information You can Remove Information The LSTM does have the ability to remove or add information to the cell state, carefully regulated by structures called gates. Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means \u201clet nothing through,\u201d while a value of one means \u201clet everything through!\u201d An LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state. Step-by-Step LSTM Walk Through The first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we\u2019re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the \u201cforget gate layer.\u201d It looks at ht\u22121 and xt, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state Ct\u22121. A 1 represents \u201ccompletely keep this\u201d while a 0 represents \u201ccompletely get rid of this.\u201d Let\u2019s go back to our example of a language model trying to predict the next word based on all the previous ones. In such a problem, the cell state might include the gender of the present subject, so that the correct pronouns can be used. When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject. The next step is to decide what new information we\u2019re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the \u201cinput gate layer\u201d decides which values we\u2019ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, C\u0303 t , that could be added to the state. In the next step, we\u2019ll combine these two to create an update to the state. In the example of our language model, we\u2019d want to add the gender of the new subject to the cell state, to replace the old one we\u2019re forgetting. It\u2019s now time to update the old cell state, Ct\u22121 , into the new cell state Ct . The previous steps already decided what to do, we just need to actually do it. We multiply the old state by ft , forgetting the things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add it\u2217C\u0303 t. This is the new candidate values, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value. In the case of the language model, this is where we\u2019d actually drop the information about the old subject\u2019s gender and add the new information, as we decided in the previous steps. Finally, we need to decide what we\u2019re going to output. This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we\u2019re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between \u22121 and 1 ) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to. For the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that\u2019s what is coming next. For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that\u2019s what follows next. Variants on Long Short Term Memory # What I\u2019ve described so far is a pretty normal LSTM. But not all LSTMs are the same as the above. In fact, it seems like almost every paper involving LSTMs uses a slightly different version. The differences are minor, but it\u2019s worth mentioning some of them. One popular LSTM variant, introduced by Gers & Schmidhuber (2000), is adding \u201cpeephole connections.\u201d This means that we let the gate layers look at the cell state. The above diagram adds peepholes to all the gates, but many papers will give some peepholes and not others. Another variation is to use coupled forget and input gates. Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we\u2019re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older. A slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by Cho, et al. (2014). It combines the forget and input gates into a single \u201cupdate gate.\u201d It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular. These are only a few of the most notable LSTM variants. There are lots of others, like Depth Gated RNNs by Yao, et al. (2015). There\u2019s also some completely different approach to tackling long-term dependencies, like Clockwork RNNs by Koutnik, et al. (2014). Which of these variants is best? Do the differences matter? Greff, et al. (2015) do a nice comparison of popular variants, finding that they\u2019re all about the same. Jozefowicz, et al. (2015) tested more than ten thousand RNN architectures, finding some that worked better than LSTMs on certain tasks. Conclusion # Earlier, I mentioned the remarkable results people are achieving with RNNs. Essentially all of these are achieved using LSTMs. They really work a lot better for most tasks! Written down as a set of equations, LSTMs look pretty intimidating. Hopefully, walking through them step by step in this essay has made them a bit more approachable. LSTMs were a big step in what we can accomplish with RNNs. It\u2019s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: \u201cYes! There is a next step and it\u2019s attention!\u201d The idea is to let every step of an RNN pick information to look at from some larger collection of information. For example, if you are using an RNN to create a caption describing an image, it might pick a part of the image to look at for every word it outputs. In fact, Xu, et al. (2015) do exactly this \u2013 it might be a fun starting point if you want to explore attention! There\u2019s been a number of really exciting results using attention, and it seems like a lot more are around the corner\u2026 Attention isn\u2019t the only exciting thread in RNN research. For example, Grid LSTMs by Kalchbrenner, et al. (2015) seem extremely promising. Work using RNNs in generative models \u2013 such as Gregor, et al. (2015), Chung, et al. (2015), or Bayer & Osendorfer (2015) \u2013 also seems very interesting. The last few years have been an exciting time for recurrent neural networks, and the coming ones promise to only be more so! Extra Understanding # Long Short terl Memory Memory Cell Forget Cell Input Cell Relu # Can actually cause dead neurons duraing back propagation. My name is Ganesh and I want to eat Pizza When I am trying to use the RNN , what RNN will do? Each and every word it will try to convert in to vectors to make sure it consider that each and every word is important. Suppose if something we have missed, suppose let say Pizza dependent on some word like it. This case you know that \"eat\" is just before the \"Pizza\" so it is being able to capture the context by with the help of RNN and also it will be able to capture the context. But over here you can see another word \"I\" I is definitly related to \"Ganesh\" I is basically giving the context of \"Ganesh\". This is only one word distance. But think about \"I\" and \"My\" can also be related. There should be some kind of context and Important context. Here you can see the distance is quite long. What memory do? (Sometime you need to remember something, sometimes you need to forget something ) LSTM Context Switching Example # Example # Ganesh likes AIML \u2192 This is one context. Ram likes DevSecOps \u2192 This is another context. From context 1 to context 2 , a switch happens because the topic (or subject) changes \u2014 we are now talking about a different person. Let\u2019s say in the previous step (cell), we passed the information: \"Ganesh likes AIML\" In the next step, the context changes. When this happens, if we want our neural network to predict future words, it should only be based on the new context . It should not remember the previous context at this moment. So, the old context ( Ganesh likes AIML ) will be forgotten , and the new context will be added. Forget Gate Behavior # Most of the information in such a context-switching scenario will be close to [0] because the forget gate will filter it out. The forget gate uses a sigmoid activation function that outputs values between [0, 1] . If the previous information is similar to the new context \u2192 values will be close to 1 (retain it). If it is different \u2192 values will be close to 0 (forget it). When values are near 0 , the memory cell is instructed to forget the old information. This is done through pointwise multiplication in the forward pass. Adding New Information # We now want to store the new word \"friend\" in the memory cell. Sigmoid gate decides how much of the new information should be stored (values in [0, 1] ). The same input passes through a tanh activation function, producing values in the range [-1, 1] . Outputs from sigmoid and tanh are combined element-wise . The result is added to the memory cell , updating it with only the important parts of the new context. Summary # Pointwise operation ensures that only important new information passes through and merges with the memory cell. Old, irrelevant context is discarded when the forget gate outputs values close to 0 .

What is a Bidirectional LSTM? # A Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is an extension of the traditional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. Instead of processing the sequence in only one direction (forward in time), BiLSTM processes the sequence in both directions : Forward LSTM \u2192 Reads the sequence from start to end. Backward LSTM \u2192 Reads the sequence from end to start. The outputs from both directions are then combined (either concatenated, summed, or averaged) to make the final prediction. 2. Why use Bidirectional LSTM? # Some tasks require understanding both past and future context in a sequence. Standard LSTM: Has access only to past information . BiLSTM: Has access to both past and future information at each time step. This is especially useful in: - Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Speech Recognition - Handwriting Recognition - Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Sentiment Analysis 3. Real-Life Example # Problem: # We want to predict the sentiment (Positive/Negative) of a sentence. Sentence: \"The movie was not bad\" Why BiLSTM helps: # If we read only forward , we might think \"The movie was not...\" is negative . But when reading backward as well, we see the word \"bad\" preceded by \"not\" , which changes the meaning to positive . A BiLSTM can use both forward and backward context to correctly understand that the sentiment is Positive . 4. How it works step-by-step: # Input sentence is tokenized into a sequence of words: [\"The\", \"movie\", \"was\", \"not\", \"bad\"] Forward LSTM processes: The \u2192 movie \u2192 was \u2192 not \u2192 bad At each word position, both forward and backward hidden states are concatenated: Hidden_state_t = [Forward_hidden_t ; Backward_hidden_t] Final combined representation is passed to a classifier (e.g., Softmax for sentiment prediction). 5.

Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means \u201clet nothing through,\u201d while a value of one means \u201clet everything through!\u201d An LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state. Step-by-Step LSTM Walk Through The first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we\u2019re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the \u201cforget gate layer.\u201d It looks at ht\u22121 and xt, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state Ct\u22121. A 1 represents \u201ccompletely keep this\u201d while a 0 represents \u201ccompletely get rid of this.\u201d Let\u2019s go back to our example of a language model trying to predict the next word based on all the previous ones. In such a problem, the cell state might include the gender of the present subject, so that the correct pronouns can be used. When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject. The next step is to decide what new information we\u2019re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the \u201cinput gate layer\u201d decides which values we\u2019ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, C\u0303 t , that could be added to the state. In the next step, we\u2019ll combine these two to create an update to the state. In the example of our language model, we\u2019d want to add the gender of the new subject to the cell state, to replace the old one we\u2019re forgetting. It\u2019s now time to update the old cell state, Ct\u22121 , into the new cell state Ct . The previous steps already decided what to do, we just need to actually do it. We multiply the old state by ft , forgetting the things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add it\u2217C\u0303 t. This is the new candidate values, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value. In the case of the language model, this is where we\u2019d actually drop the information about the old subject\u2019s gender and add the new information, as we decided in the previous steps. Finally, we need to decide what we\u2019re going to output. This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we\u2019re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between \u22121 and 1 ) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to. For the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that\u2019s what is coming next. For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that\u2019s what follows next.","title":"Memory Cell"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/LSTM.html#variants-on-long-short-term-memory","text":"What I\u2019ve described so far is a pretty normal LSTM. But not all LSTMs are the same as the above. In fact, it seems like almost every paper involving LSTMs uses a slightly different version. The differences are minor, but it\u2019s worth mentioning some of them. One popular LSTM variant, introduced by Gers & Schmidhuber (2000), is adding \u201cpeephole connections.\u201d This means that we let the gate layers look at the cell state. The above diagram adds peepholes to all the gates, but many papers will give some peepholes and not others. Another variation is to use coupled forget and input gates. Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we\u2019re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older. A slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by Cho, et al. (2014). It combines the forget and input gates into a single \u201cupdate gate.\u201d It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular. These are only a few of the most notable LSTM variants. There are lots of others, like Depth Gated RNNs by Yao, et al. (2015). There\u2019s also some completely different approach to tackling long-term dependencies, like Clockwork RNNs by Koutnik, et al. (2014). Which of these variants is best? Do the differences matter? Greff, et al. (2015) do a nice comparison of popular variants, finding that they\u2019re all about the same. Jozefowicz, et al.

It\u2019s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: \u201cYes! There is a next step and it\u2019s attention!\u201d The idea is to let every step of an RNN pick information to look at from some larger collection of information. For example, if you are using an RNN to create a caption describing an image, it might pick a part of the image to look at for every word it outputs. In fact, Xu, et al. (2015) do exactly this \u2013 it might be a fun starting point if you want to explore attention!

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) differ from regular neural networks in how they process information. While standard neural networks pass information in one direction i.e from input to output, RNNs feed information back into the network at each step. Imagine reading a sentence and you try to predict the next word, you don\u2019t rely only on the current word but also remember the words that came before. RNNs work similarly by \u201cremembering\u201d past information and passing the output from one step as input to the next i.e it considers all the earlier words to choose the most likely next word. This memory of previous steps helps the network understand context and make better predictions. \ud83d\udcccKey Components of RNNs There are mainly two components of RNNs 1. Recurrent Neurons The fundamental processing unit in RNN is a Recurrent Unit. They hold a hidden state that maintains information about previous inputs in a sequence. Recurrent units can \"remember\" information from prior steps by feeding back their hidden state, allowing them to capture dependencies across time. 2. RNN Unfolding RNN unfolding or unrolling is the process of expanding the recurrent structure over time steps. During unfolding each step of the sequence is represented as a separate layer in a series illustrating how information flows across each time step. \ud83d\udcccRecurrent Neural Network Architecture RNNs share similarities in input and output structures with other deep learning architectures but differ significantly in how information flows from input to output. Unlike traditional deep neural networks where each dense layer has distinct weight matrices. RNNs use shared weights across time steps, allowing them to remember information over sequences. In deep learning, especially when discussing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the expression Y=f(X,h,W,U,V,B,C) is essentially describing the forward pass equation , where Y is the output and f is a function of the inputs, hidden state, and parameters . The Parameters and Variables Symbol Meaning X Input at the current time step t h Hidden state from the previous time step (t\u22121) W Weight matrix for input-to-hidden connections U Weight matrix for hidden-to-hidden (recurrent) connections V Weight matrix for hidden-to-output connections B Bias vector for hidden layer C Bias vector for output layer This function defines the entire RNN operation where the state matrix S holds each element si representing the network's state at each time step i. How does RNN work? At each time step RNNs process units with a fixed activation function. These units have an internal hidden state that acts as memory that retains information from previous time steps. This memory allows the network to store past knowledge and adapt based on new inputs. Updating the Hidden State in RNNs Meaning of terms Symbol Meaning h\u209c Hidden state at time step t h\u209c\u208b\u2081 Hidden state from the previous time step (t\u22121) x\u209c Input vector at time step t W\u2095\u2095 Weight matrix for hidden-to-hidden (recurrent) connection W\u2093\u2095 Weight matrix for input-to-hidden connection tanh Non-linear activation function that squashes output to the range (\u22121, 1) \ud83d\udcccBackpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in RNNs Since RNNs process sequential data Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is used to update the network's parameters. The loss function L(\u03b8) depends on the final hidden state h3 and each hidden state relies on preceding ones forming a sequential dependency chain: In BPTT, gradients are backpropagated through each time step. This is essential for updating network parameters based on temporal dependencies. Simplified Gradient Calculation: It\u2019s basically the chain rule from calculus applied to neural network training. What each term means Symbol Meaning L(\u03b8) Loss function, depends on all model parameters \u03b8 (including weight matrices like W ) W Weight matrix (can be W\u2093\u2095 , W\u2095\u2095 , etc.) h\u2083 Hidden state at time step t = 3 \u2202L(\u03b8) / \u2202h\u2083 How much the loss changes if h\u2083 changes (error signal at time step 3) \u2202h\u2083 / \u2202W How much h\u2083 changes if W changes (sensitivity of hidden state to weights) 2. Handling Dependencies in Layers: Each hidden state is updated based on its dependencies: Symbol Meaning h\u2083 Hidden state at time step 3 W Weight matrix (could be recurrent W\u2095\u2095 ) h\u2082 Hidden state at time step 2 b Bias vector \u03c3 Activation function (e.g., tanh , ReLU, sigmoid) The gradient is then calculated for each state, considering dependencies from previous hidden states. 3. Gradient Calculation with Explicit and Implicit Parts: The gradient is broken down into explicit and implicit parts summing up the indirect paths from each hidden state to the weights. 4. Final Gradient Expression: The final derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight matrix W is computed: This iterative process is the essence of backpropagation through time. \ud83d\udcccTypes Of Recurrent Neural Networks* There are four types of RNNs based on the number of inputs and outputs in the network: \ud83d\udccc1. One-to-One RNN* This is the simplest type of neural network architecture where there is a single input and a single output. It is used for straightforward classification tasks such as binary classification where no sequential data is involved. \ud83d\udccc2. One-to-Many RNN* In a One-to-Many RNN the network processes a single input to produce multiple outputs over time. This is useful in tasks where one input triggers a sequence of predictions (outputs). For example in image captioning a single image can be used as input to generate a sequence of words as a caption. \ud83d\udccc3. Many-to-One RNN* The Many-to-One RNN receives a sequence of inputs and generates a single output. This type is useful when the overall context of the input sequence is needed to make one prediction. In sentiment analysis the model receives a sequence of words (like a sentence) and produces a single output like positive, negative or neutral. \ud83d\udccc4. Many-to-Many RNN* The Many-to-Many RNN type processes a sequence of inputs and generates a sequence of outputs. In language translation task a sequence of words in one language is given as input and a corresponding sequence in another language is generated as output. \ud83d\udcccVariants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)* There are several variations of RNNs, each designed to address specific challenges or optimize for certain tasks: 1. Vanilla RNN This simplest form of RNN consists of a single hidden layer where weights are shared across time steps. Vanilla RNNs are suitable for learning short-term dependencies but are limited by the vanishing gradient problem, which hampers long-sequence learning. 2. Bidirectional RNNs Bidirectional RNNs process inputs in both forward and backward directions, capturing both past and future context for each time step. This architecture is ideal for tasks where the entire sequence is available, such as named entity recognition and question answering. 3. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) introduce a memory mechanism to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. Each LSTM cell has three gates: Input Gate: Controls how much new information should be added to the cell state. Forget Gate: Decides what past information should be discarded. Output Gate: Regulates what information should be output at the current step. This selective memory enables LSTMs to handle long-term dependencies, making them ideal for tasks where earlier context is critical. 4. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) simplify LSTMs by combining the input and forget gates into a single update gate and streamlining the output mechanism. This design is computationally efficient, often performing similarly to LSTMs and is useful in tasks where simplicity and faster training are beneficial. \ud83d\udcccHow RNN Differs from Feedforward Neural Networks?* Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) process data in one direction from input to output without retaining information from previous inputs. This makes them suitable for tasks with independent inputs like image classification. However FNNs struggle with sequential data since they lack memory. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) solve this by incorporating loops that allow information from previous steps to be fed back into the network. This feedback enables RNNs to remember prior inputs making them ideal for tasks where context is important. \ud83d\udcccImplementing a Text Generator Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)* We will create a character-based text generator using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in TensorFlow and Keras. We'll implement an RNN that learns patterns from a text sequence to generate new text character-by-character. Example: # 1. Importing Necessary Libraries # import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN , Dense numpy for array manipulation, tensorflow / keras for the model. Sequential builds a stack of layers. SimpleRNN = vanilla RNN layer. Dense = fully connected output layer. 2. Defining the Input Text and Prepare Character Set # We define the input text and identify unique characters in the text which we\u2019ll encode for our model. text = \"Kurudusonnehalli Main Rd, Sonnenahalli Colony, Krishnarajapuram, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560049\" chars = sorted ( list ( set ( text ))) char_to_index = { char : i for i , char in enumerate ( chars )} index_to_char = { i : char for i , char in enumerate ( chars )} You build a vocabulary of all distinct characters in text . chars is the sorted list of unique characters (spaces, commas, digits, letters, etc.). char_to_index / index_to_char convert between character \u2194 integer index (one-hot indexing). In this specific string: len(text) = 92 characters total. len(chars) = 31 distinct characters (so vocabulary size = 31). 3. Creating Sequences and Labels # To train the RNN, we need sequences of fixed length (seq_length) and the character following each sequence as the label. seq_length = 3 sequences = [] labels = [] for i in range ( len ( text ) - seq_length ) : seq = text [ i:i + seq_length ] label = text [ i + seq_length ] sequences . append ( [ char_to_index[char ] for char in seq ] ) labels . append ( char_to_index [ label ] ) X = np . array ( sequences ) y = np . array ( labels ) You create sliding windows of length seq_length=3 . For each window seq = text[i:i+3] , the label is the next character text[i+3] . Example: if text = \"abcdef...\" and seq_length=3 , samples are (\"abc\" -> \"d\"), (\"bcd\" -> \"e\"), .... Number of training samples = len(text) - seq_length = 89. So after this: X (as indices) shape: (89, 3) \u2014 89 sequences, each 3 indices long. y (as indices) shape: (89,) \u2014 1 label per sequence. 4. Converting Sequences and Labels to One-Hot Encoding # For training we convert X and y into one-hot encoded tensors. X_one_hot = tf.one_hot(X, len(chars)) y_one_hot = tf.one_hot(y, len(chars)) tf.one_hot(X, len(chars)) converts each index to a one-hot vector of length 31. Final training tensors: X_one_hot : shape (num_samples, timesteps, input_dim) = (89, 3, 31) . y_one_hot : shape (num_samples, num_classes) = (89, 31) . Notes: X_one_hot dtype is float32 by default. Keras accepts tf.Tensor inputs. For large vocabularies, one-hot is memory-inefficient \u2014 embeddings are preferred. 5. Building the RNN Model # We create a simple RNN model with a hidden layer of 50 units and a Dense output layer with softmax activation. model = Sequential () model . add ( SimpleRNN ( 50 , input_shape =( seq_length , len ( chars )), activation = ' relu ' )) model . add ( Dense ( len ( chars ), activation = ' softmax ' )) Two layers: SimpleRNN(50, input_shape=(3, 31), activation='relu') Units = 50 \u2192 hidden state vector size = 50. Input shape = (timesteps, features) = (3, 31) . Default return_sequences=False so the layer outputs the final hidden state h_T for the whole sequence (shape ( batch_size, 50) ). Math (per time step t): pre-activation: z_t = x_t @ W_xh + h_{t-1} @ W_hh + b_h W_xh : shape (input_dim, units) = (31, 50) W_hh : shape (units, units) = (50, 50) b_h : shape (50,) hidden update: h_t = relu(z_t) (here ReLU used instead of tanh) Initial hidden state h_0 defaults to zeros. Dense(len(chars), activation='softmax') Fully connected layer from 50 \u2192 31 output logits. softmax turns logits into a probability distribution over the 31 characters: logits: logits = h_T @ W_hy + b_y (W_hy shape (50, 31)) y_pred = softmax(logits) 6. Compiling and Training the Model # We compile the model using the categorical_crossentropy loss and train it for 100 epochs. model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model.fit(X_one_hot, y_one_hot, epochs=100) optimizer='adam' : adaptive optimizer (default lr=0.001). loss='categorical_crossentropy' : appropriate for multi-class one-hot labels: metrics=['accuracy'] : computes fraction where argmax(y_pred) == argmax(y_true) . model.fit(...) : Default batch_size=32 . With 89 samples you get 3 batches per epoch: 32 + 32 + 25. epochs=100 \u2014 small dataset; 100 epochs likely causes overfitting. 7. Generating New Text Using the Trained Model # After training we use a starting sequence to generate new text character by character. start_seq = \"Kurudusonnehalli\" generated_text = start_seq for i in range ( 40 ) : x = np . array ( [ [char_to_index[char ] for char in generated_text [ -seq_length: ] ]] ) x_one_hot = tf . one_hot ( x , len ( chars )) prediction = model . predict ( x_one_hot ) next_index = np . argmax ( prediction ) next_char = index_to_char [ next_index ] generated_text += next_char print ( \"Generated Text:\" ) print ( generated_text ) start_seq = \"Kurudusonnehalli\" seeds generation (must be characters that exist in char_to_index ). Each iteration: Take last seq_length characters of generated_text . Convert to indices \u2192 shape (1, 3) (a batch of 1). One-hot \u2192 (1, 3, 31) . model.predict returns probabilities shape (1, 31) . np.argmax picks the highest-probability character (greedy).` Append predicted char to generated_text and repeat.

The Transformer is a neural network architecture that relies entirely on a mechanism called self-attention to process sequential data, like text. Unlike previous models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that process data word-by-word in order, the Transformer processes the entire input sequence at once. This design allows for massive parallelization, dramatically speeding up training time and enabling it to learn long-range dependencies in data more effectively. \ud83d\udccc A High-Level Look Let\u2019s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another. A Transformer is typically composed of two main parts: The Encoder: This part processes the input sentence (e.g., \"Je suis \u00e9tudiant\"). It reads the entire sentence at once and builds a rich numerical representation (a set of vectors) for each word that captures its meaning in the context of the full sentence. The Decoder: This part generates the output sentence (e.g., \"I am a student\") word by word. At each step, it looks at the representations created by the encoder and the words it has already generated to decide which word to produce next. The encoder's job is to read and understand the input sentence in its entirety. Think of it as a specialist reader. It takes the input sentence, \"Je suis \u00e9tudiant,\" and looks at all the words at once. Using a mechanism called self-attention, it figures out how each word in the sentence relates to all the other words in that same sentence. It learns that \"Je\" is the subject and \"suis\" is the verb connected to it, for example. The final output of the encoder isn't another sentence; it's a set of numerical representations (vectors). You can think of these as rich, context-aware \"notes\" that capture the meaning of the input sentence. The Decoder: The Writer \u270d\ufe0f # The decoder's job is to generate the output sentence word by word. It's a generative process. To start, it might be given a special \"start\" token. Then, to generate the first word (\"I\"), it relies on two key sources of information: What it has already written: In the beginning, this is just the \"start\" token. Later, when generating \"am,\" it will look back at \"I.\" This is a form of self-attention, but it's \"masked\" so the decoder can't cheat by looking ahead at words it hasn't generated yet. The Encoder's Notes: This is the critical connection you mentioned! The decoder pays attention to the numerical representations created by the encoder. When it's trying to generate the English translation, it looks across the encoded French sentence to find the most relevant information. As it generates \"student,\" it will pay strong attention to the encoder's notes for the word \"\u00e9tudiant.\" This is often called encoder-decoder attention or cross-attention. This process repeats\u2014generating one word at a time, looking at the encoder's notes and its own previous output\u2014until it produces a special \"end of sentence\" token. we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and connections between them. The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other \u2013 there\u2019s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. The Encoder Stack: Deepening the Understanding When the input \"Je suis \u00e9tudiant\" enters the first encoder, the model might learn some basic relationships. As the output of that encoder is passed to the second, and then the third, and so on, the model builds a more sophisticated understanding. Layer 1: Might learn simple grammatical connections. Layers 2-4: Could start to understand the semantic meaning and disambiguate words. Layers 5-6: Can capture long-range dependencies and subtle contextual nuances across the entire sentence. By the time the data emerges from the top of the sixth encoder, the model has a very rich, multi-layered representation of the source sentence's meaning. The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: 1. The Self-Attention Layer: The Contextualizer For every single word, the self-attention mechanism generates a score against every other word in the sentence. A high score means the words are highly relevant to each other. It effectively asks, \"To understand the meaning of this specific word in this context, which other words should I pay the most attention to?\" 2. The Feed-Forward Network: The Processor After the self-attention layer has gathered and blended the contextual information, the output is passed to a simple but crucial Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) This is a standard, fully connected neural network. Importantly, it processes the representation for each word independently. While the self-attention layer was all about inter-word communication, the FFN allows for a deeper, more complex transformation of each word's individual representation. The final output of the encoder layer, which is then passed up to the next encoder in the stack. Identical in Structure, but No Shared Weights Identical Structure: Every encoder in the stack has this same Attention-FFN setup. This makes the architecture neat and consistent. No Shared Weights: Each of the six encoder layers learns its own unique set of parameters (weights). This is what allows for the hierarchical learning we discussed. If they all had the same weights, stacking them would be redundant. Because they are independent, Encoder Layer 1 can learn to focus on syntactic relationships, while Encoder Layer 6 can learn to capture more abstract semantic meaning. The encoder\u2019s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer \u2013 a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence Bringing The Tensors Into The Picture Now that we\u2019ve seen the major components of the model, let\u2019s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output. As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an embedding algorithm. The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 \u2013 In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that\u2019s directly below. The size of this list is hyperparameter we can set \u2013 basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset. After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. Next, we\u2019ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we\u2019ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder. Now We\u2019re Encoding! # As we\u2019ve mentioned already, an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a \u2018self-attention\u2019 layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. Self-Attention at a High Level # Don\u2019t be fooled by me throwing around the word \u201cself-attention\u201d like it\u2019s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works. Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate: The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired What does \u201cit\u201d in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It\u2019s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. When the model is processing the word \u201cit\u201d, self-attention allows it to associate \u201cit\u201d with \u201canimal\u201d. As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. If you\u2019re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it\u2019s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the \u201cunderstanding\u201d of other relevant words into the one we\u2019re currently processing. Self-Attention in Detail Let\u2019s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it\u2019s actually implemented \u2013 using matrices. The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder\u2019s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector Key vector Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. Transformer Attention Vector Dimensions # 1. Context # In the Transformer architecture, embedding vectors and encoder input/output vectors typically have a dimensionality of 512 . However, the vectors used inside multi-head attention (query, key, and value vectors) often have a smaller dimensionality \u2014 in this example, 64 . 2. Why Smaller Dimensions for Attention? # Design Choice : The reduced dimensionality is not mandatory , but is chosen to make the computation of multi-head attention more efficient . Computation Cost : Multi-head attention involves matrix multiplications for multiple attention heads. By reducing the vector size, the computation for each head remains (mostly) constant regardless of the total embedding size. 3. Example: Multi-Head Attention Dimension Split # Given: # Embedding size = 512 Number of heads = 8 Dimension per head = 512 \u00f7 8 = 64 Process: # The input embedding (512-d) is projected into: Query vectors (Q) \u2192 64 dimensions per head Key vectors (K) \u2192 64 dimensions per head Value vectors (V) \u2192 64 dimensions per head Each attention head operates independently on its 64-dimensional vectors. The outputs from all heads are concatenated back to 512 dimensions . 4. Benefits of This Design # Efficiency : Reduces the matrix multiplication cost per head. Parallelization : Multiple heads run in parallel without exploding computational requirements. Flexibility : The per-head dimension (64 here) can be tuned based on memory and compute budgets. 5. Visual Representation # What are the \u201cquery\u201d, \u201ckey\u201d, and \u201cvalue\u201d vectors? Query, Key, and Value Vectors in Attention # 1. What Are Q, K, and V? # In the attention mechanism (used in Transformers), each input token is represented by three vectors : Query (Q) \u2192 What am I looking for? Key (K) \u2192 What do I contain? Value (V) \u2192 The actual content I can offer. They are learned projections of the same input embedding. 2. How Are They Created? # For each token embedding x (e.g., 512-dimensional), we compute: Q = x \u00d7 W_Q K = x \u00d7 W_K V = x \u00d7 W_V Where: - W_Q , W_K , W_V are learnable weight matrices . - The resulting Q, K, and V vectors are usually smaller in dimension (e.g., 64 for each head). 3. Analogy # Imagine a library : Query : Your search request (e.g., \"books about AI\"). Key : The labels on each book in the library (metadata). Value : The full text/content of the book. The attention mechanism matches Query with Keys to decide which Values to retrieve. 4. How They Work in Attention # Similarity Calculation Compare each Query with all Keys using a dot product : score = Q \u00b7 K^T This produces a measure of how relevant each key is to the query. Scaling and Softmax Scale scores by \u221ad_k (dimension of key) and apply softmax to get attention weights: attention_weights = softmax(score / \u221ad_k) Weighted Sum of Values Multiply each Value vector by its corresponding attention weight and sum: output = \u03a3 (attention_weight \u00d7 V) This output is a context vector \u2014 a blend of relevant values based on the query. 5. Formula # The scaled dot-product attention formula is: 6. Example # Sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat\" The word \"cat\" (as a query) might have high similarity to \"sat\" and \"mat\" in the key space, so the context vector for \"cat\" will focus more on values from those words. 7. Visual Diagram (Conceptual) # Embedding \u2192 Linear(W_Q) \u2192 Query (Q) \u2192 Linear(W_K) \u2192 Key (K) \u2192 Linear(W_V) \u2192 Value (V) Q \u00d7 K^T \u2192 Scale \u2192 Softmax \u2192 Weights \u00d7 V \u2192 Context Vector 8. Key Takeaway # Query : What information this token is looking for. Key : What information this token contains. Value : The actual information content to pass forward. Attention finds matches between Q and K to decide which V matters most. They\u2019re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you\u2019ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays. The second step in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we\u2019re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, \u201cThinking\u201d. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we\u2019re scoring. So if we\u2019re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. The third and fourth steps are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper \u2013 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they\u2019re all positive and add up to 1. This softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it\u2019s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. The fifth step is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example). The sixth step is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let\u2019s look at that now that we\u2019ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention # Finally , since we\u2019re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer. The Beast With Many Heads # The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called \u201cmulti-headed\u201d attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways: It expands the model\u2019s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we\u2019re translating a sentence like \u201cThe animal didn\u2019t cross the street because it was too tired\u201d, it would be useful to know which word \u201cit\u201d refers to. It gives the attention layer multiple \u201crepresentation subspaces\u201d. As we\u2019ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. If we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices \u2013 it\u2019s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix. How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO. That\u2019s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It\u2019s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let\u2019s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word \u201cit\u201d in our example sentence: If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret: Representing The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding # One thing that\u2019s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence. To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they\u2019re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this: The Residuals # One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a layer-normalization step. If we\u2019re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this: This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we\u2019re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this: The Decoder Side # Now that we\u2019ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let\u2019s take a look at how they work together. The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its \u201cencoder-decoder attention\u201d layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word. The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder: In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to -inf) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation. The \u201cEncoder-Decoder Attention\u201d layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. The Final Linear and Softmax Layer # The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That\u2019s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer. The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector. Let\u2019s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model\u2019s \u201coutput vocabulary\u201d) that it\u2019s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide \u2013 each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer. The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. Recap Of Training # Now that we\u2019ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model. During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output. To visualize this, let\u2019s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(\u201ca\u201d, \u201cam\u201d, \u201ci\u201d, \u201cthanks\u201d, \u201cstudent\u201d, and \u201c \u201d (short for \u2018end of sentence\u2019)). Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word \u201cam\u201d using the following vector: Following this recap, let\u2019s discuss the model\u2019s loss function \u2013 the metric we are optimizing during the training phase to lead up to a trained and hopefully amazingly accurate model. The Loss Function # Say we are training our model. Say it\u2019s our first step in the training phase, and we\u2019re training it on a simple example \u2013 translating \u201cmerci\u201d into \u201cthanks\u201d. What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word \u201cthanks\u201d. But since this model is not yet trained, that\u2019s unlikely to happen just yet. How do you compare two probability distributions? We simply subtract one from the other. But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we\u2019ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example \u2013 input: \u201cje suis \u00e9tudiant\u201d and expected output: \u201ci am a student\u201d. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where: Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000) The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word \u201ci\u201d The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word \u201cam\u201d And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates \u2018 \u2019 symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary. After training the model for enough time on a large enough dataset, we would hope the produced probability distributions would look like this: Hugginface # Of course.

It's a generative process. To start, it might be given a special \"start\" token. Then, to generate the first word (\"I\"), it relies on two key sources of information: What it has already written: In the beginning, this is just the \"start\" token. Later, when generating \"am,\" it will look back at \"I.\" This is a form of self-attention, but it's \"masked\" so the decoder can't cheat by looking ahead at words it hasn't generated yet. The Encoder's Notes: This is the critical connection you mentioned! The decoder pays attention to the numerical representations created by the encoder. When it's trying to generate the English translation, it looks across the encoded French sentence to find the most relevant information. As it generates \"student,\" it will pay strong attention to the encoder's notes for the word \"\u00e9tudiant.\" This is often called encoder-decoder attention or cross-attention. This process repeats\u2014generating one word at a time, looking at the encoder's notes and its own previous output\u2014until it produces a special \"end of sentence\" token. we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and connections between them. The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other \u2013 there\u2019s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. The Encoder Stack: Deepening the Understanding When the input \"Je suis \u00e9tudiant\" enters the first encoder, the model might learn some basic relationships. As the output of that encoder is passed to the second, and then the third, and so on, the model builds a more sophisticated understanding. Layer 1: Might learn simple grammatical connections. Layers 2-4: Could start to understand the semantic meaning and disambiguate words. Layers 5-6: Can capture long-range dependencies and subtle contextual nuances across the entire sentence. By the time the data emerges from the top of the sixth encoder, the model has a very rich, multi-layered representation of the source sentence's meaning. The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: 1. The Self-Attention Layer: The Contextualizer For every single word, the self-attention mechanism generates a score against every other word in the sentence. A high score means the words are highly relevant to each other. It effectively asks, \"To understand the meaning of this specific word in this context, which other words should I pay the most attention to?\" 2. The Feed-Forward Network: The Processor After the self-attention layer has gathered and blended the contextual information, the output is passed to a simple but crucial Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) This is a standard, fully connected neural network. Importantly, it processes the representation for each word independently. While the self-attention layer was all about inter-word communication, the FFN allows for a deeper, more complex transformation of each word's individual representation. The final output of the encoder layer, which is then passed up to the next encoder in the stack. Identical in Structure, but No Shared Weights Identical Structure: Every encoder in the stack has this same Attention-FFN setup. This makes the architecture neat and consistent. No Shared Weights: Each of the six encoder layers learns its own unique set of parameters (weights). This is what allows for the hierarchical learning we discussed. If they all had the same weights, stacking them would be redundant. Because they are independent, Encoder Layer 1 can learn to focus on syntactic relationships, while Encoder Layer 6 can learn to capture more abstract semantic meaning. The encoder\u2019s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer \u2013 a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence Bringing The Tensors Into The Picture Now that we\u2019ve seen the major components of the model, let\u2019s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output. As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an embedding algorithm. The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 \u2013 In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that\u2019s directly below. The size of this list is hyperparameter we can set \u2013 basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset. After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. Next, we\u2019ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we\u2019ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.","title":"The Decoder: The Writer \u270d\ufe0f"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#now-were-encoding","text":"As we\u2019ve mentioned already, an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a \u2018self-attention\u2019 layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.","title":"Now We\u2019re Encoding!"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#self-attention-at-a-high-level","text":"Don\u2019t be fooled by me throwing around the word \u201cself-attention\u201d like it\u2019s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works. Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate: The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired What does \u201cit\u201d in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It\u2019s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. When the model is processing the word \u201cit\u201d, self-attention allows it to associate \u201cit\u201d with \u201canimal\u201d. As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. If you\u2019re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it\u2019s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the \u201cunderstanding\u201d of other relevant words into the one we\u2019re currently processing. Self-Attention in Detail Let\u2019s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it\u2019s actually implemented \u2013 using matrices. The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder\u2019s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector Key vector Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.","title":"Self-Attention at a High Level"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#transformer-attention-vector-dimensions","text":"","title":"Transformer Attention Vector Dimensions"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#1-context","text":"In the Transformer architecture, embedding vectors and encoder input/output vectors typically have a dimensionality of 512 .

Value : The actual information content to pass forward. Attention finds matches between Q and K to decide which V matters most. They\u2019re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you\u2019ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays. The second step in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we\u2019re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, \u201cThinking\u201d. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we\u2019re scoring. So if we\u2019re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. The third and fourth steps are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper \u2013 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they\u2019re all positive and add up to 1. This softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it\u2019s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. The fifth step is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example). The sixth step is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let\u2019s look at that now that we\u2019ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level.","title":"8. Key Takeaway"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#matrix-calculation-of-self-attention","text":"Finally , since we\u2019re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.","title":"Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#the-beast-with-many-heads","text":"The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called \u201cmulti-headed\u201d attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways: It expands the model\u2019s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we\u2019re translating a sentence like \u201cThe animal didn\u2019t cross the street because it was too tired\u201d, it would be useful to know which word \u201cit\u201d refers to. It gives the attention layer multiple \u201crepresentation subspaces\u201d. As we\u2019ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. If we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices \u2013 it\u2019s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix. How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO. That\u2019s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It\u2019s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let\u2019s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word \u201cit\u201d in our example sentence: If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:","title":"The Beast With Many Heads"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#representing-the-order-of-the-sequence-using-positional-encoding","text":"One thing that\u2019s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence. To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they\u2019re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:","title":"Representing The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#the-residuals","text":"One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a layer-normalization step.

These are to be used by each decoder in its \u201cencoder-decoder attention\u201d layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word. The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder: In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to -inf) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.

To visualize this, let\u2019s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(\u201ca\u201d, \u201cam\u201d, \u201ci\u201d, \u201cthanks\u201d, \u201cstudent\u201d, and \u201c \u201d (short for \u2018end of sentence\u2019)). Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word \u201cam\u201d using the following vector: Following this recap, let\u2019s discuss the model\u2019s loss function \u2013 the metric we are optimizing during the training phase to lead up to a trained and hopefully amazingly accurate model.","title":"Recap Of Training"},{"location":"DeepLearning/Models/Transformer.html#the-loss-function","text":"Say we are training our model. Say it\u2019s our first step in the training phase, and we\u2019re training it on a simple example \u2013 translating \u201cmerci\u201d into \u201cthanks\u201d. What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word \u201cthanks\u201d. But since this model is not yet trained, that\u2019s unlikely to happen just yet. How do you compare two probability distributions? We simply subtract one from the other. But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we\u2019ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example \u2013 input: \u201cje suis \u00e9tudiant\u201d and expected output: \u201ci am a student\u201d. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where: Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000) The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word \u201ci\u201d The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word \u201cam\u201d And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates \u2018 \u2019 symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.

Linear algebra is a core mathematical foundation for machine learning, as most datasets and models are represented using vectors and matrices. It allows efficient computation, data manipulation and optimization, making complex tasks manageable. Data in ML is represented as vectors (features) and matrices (datasets). Operations like dot product, matrix multiplication and transformations power ML algorithms. Key concepts such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors and decompositions simplify dimensionality reduction, optimization and training. Algorithms like PCA, SVD, regression, SVMs and neural networks rely heavily on linear algebra. \ud83d\udccc Fundamental Concepts in Linear Algebra for Machine Learning In machine learning, vectors , matrices and scalars play key roles in handling and processing data. 1. Vectors Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, often represented as arrows in space. 2. Matrices Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations, systems of linear equations and data transformations in machine learning. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Notation: an m\u00d7n matrix A has m rows and n columns and entries \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 (row i, column j): 3. Scalars Scalars are single numerical values, without direction, magnitude only. Scalars are just single numbers that can multiply vectors or matrices. In machine learning, they\u2019re used to adjust things like the weights in a model or the learning rate during training Operations in Linear Algebra Linear Transformations Linear transformations are basic operations in linear algebra that change vectors and matrices while keeping important properties like straight lines and proportionality. In machine learning, they are key for tasks like preparing data, creating features and training models. This section covers the definition, types and uses of linear transformations. Matrix Operations Matrix operations are central to linear algebra and widely used in machine learning for data handling, transformations and model training. The most common ones are: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe how matrices transform space, making them fundamental in many ML algorithms. Solving Linear Systems of equations Linear systems are common in machine learning for parameter estimation and optimization. Key methods include: Applications of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning Linear algebra powers many ML algorithms by enabling data manipulation, model representation and optimization. Key applications include: PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality by computing covariance, eigenvalues/eigenvectors and projecting data onto principal components. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): Factorizes a matrix into A = U\u03a3VT, used for dimensionality reduction, compression and noise filtering. Linear Regression: Models relationships via matrix form Y = X\u03b2+ \u03f5, solved using the normal equation XTX\u03b2 = XTY. SVM (Support Vector Machines): Uses the kernel trick and optimization to find decision boundaries for classification and regression. Neural Networks: Depend on matrix multiplications, gradient descent and weight initialization for training deep models.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"MCP/mcp.html","text":"\u2705 Model Context Protocol (MCP) \ud83d\udccc What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)? MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. MCP enables you to build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs and connects your models with the world. \ud83d\udccc MCP provides: A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into A standardized way to build custom integrations for AI applications An open protocol that everyone is free to implement and use The flexibility to change between different apps and take your context with you \ud83d\udccc Concepts of MCP: MCP follows a client-server architecture where an MCP host \u2014 an AI application. Client establishes connections to one or more MCP servers. The MCP host accomplishes this by creating one MCP client for each MCP server. Each MCP client maintains a dedicated one-to-one connection with its corresponding MCP server. The key participants in the MCP architecture are: MCP Host: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or multiple MCP clients MCP Client: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context from an MCP server for the MCP host to use MCP Server: A program that provides context to MCP clients For example: Visual Studio Code acts as an MCP host. When Visual Studio Code establishes a connection to an MCP server, such as the Sentry MCP server , the Visual Studio Code runtime instantiates an MCP client object that maintains the connection to the Sentry MCP server. When Visual Studio Code subsequently connects to another MCP server, such as the local filesystem server , the Visual Studio Code runtime instantiates an additional MCP client object to maintain this connection, hence maintaining a one-to-one relationship of MCP clients to MCP servers. \ud83d\udccc MCP consists of two layers: Data layer: Defines the JSON-RPC based protocol for client-server communication, including lifecycle management, and core primitives, such as tools, resources, prompts and notifications. Transport layer: Defines the communication mechanisms and channels that enable data exchange between clients and servers, including transport-specific connection establishment, message framing, and authorization. Conceptually the data layer is the inner layer, while the transport layer is the outer layer. \ud83d\udccc Data layer: The data layer implements a JSON-RPC 2.0 based exchange protocol that defines the message structure and semantics. This layer includes: Lifecycle management: Handles connection initialization, capability negotiation, and connection termination between clients and servers Server features: Enables servers to provide core functionality including tools for AI actions, resources for context data, and prompts for interaction templates from and to the client Client features: Enables servers to ask the client to sample from the host LLM, elicit input from the user, and log messages to the client Utility features: Supports additional capabilities like notifications for real-time updates and progress tracking for long-running operations \ud83d\udccc Transport layer: The transport layer manages communication channels and authentication between clients and servers. It handles connection establishment, message framing, and secure communication between MCP participants. MCP supports two transport mechanisms: Stdio transport: Uses standard input/output streams for direct process communication between local processes on the same machine, providing optimal performance with no network overhead. Streamable HTTP transport: Uses HTTP POST for client-to-server messages with optional Server-Sent Events for streaming capabilities. This transport enables remote server communication and supports standard HTTP authentication methods including bearer tokens, API keys, and custom headers. MCP recommends using OAuth to obtain authentication tokens. The transport layer abstracts communication details from the protocol layer, enabling the same JSON-RPC 2.0 message format across all transport mechanisms. \ud83d\udccc Primitives: MCP primitives are the most important concept within MCP. They define what clients and servers can offer each other. These primitives specify the types of contextual information that can be shared with AI applications and the range of actions that can be performed. MCP defines three core primitives that servers can expose: Tools: Executable functions that AI applications can invoke to perform actions (e.g., file operations, API calls, database queries) Resources: Data sources that provide contextual information to AI applications (e.g., file contents, database records, API responses) Prompts: Reusable templates that help structure interactions with language models (e.g., system prompts, few-shot examples) Each primitive type has associated methods for discovery (*/list) , retrieval (*/get) , and in some cases, execution (tools/call) . MCP clients will use the */list methods to discover available primitives. For example, a client can first list all available tools (tools/list) and then execute them. This design allows listings to be dynamic. MCP also defines primitives that clients can expose. These primitives allow MCP server authors to build richer interactions. Sampling: Allows servers to request language model completions from the client\u2019s AI application. This is useful when servers\u2019 authors want access to a language model, but want to stay model independent and not include a language model SDK in their MCP server. They can use the sampling/complete method to request a language model completion from the client\u2019s AI application. Elicitation: Allows servers to request additional information from users. This is useful when servers\u2019 authors want to get more information from the user, or ask for confirmation of an action. They can use the elicitation/request method to request additional information from the user. Logging: Enables servers to send log messages to clients for debugging and monitoring purposes. \ud83d\udccc Connect to Remote MCP Servers: Remote MCP servers extend AI applications\u2019 capabilities beyond your local environment, providing access to internet-hosted tools, services, and data sources. By connecting to remote MCP servers, you transform AI assistants from helpful tools into informed teammates capable of handling complex, multi-step projects with real-time access to external resources. Remote MCP servers function similarly to local MCP servers but are hosted on the internet rather than your local machine. They expose tools, prompts, and resources that Claude can use to perform tasks on your behalf. These servers can integrate with various services such as project management tools, documentation systems, code repositories, and any other API-enabled service. The key advantage of remote MCP servers is their accessibility. Unlike local servers that require installation and configuration on each device, remote servers are available from any MCP client with an internet connection. This makes them ideal for web-based AI applications, integrations that emphasize ease-of-use and services that require server-side processing or authentication. \ud83d\udccc What are Custom Connectors?: Custom Connectors serve as the bridge between Claude and remote MCP servers. They allow you to connect Claude directly to the tools and data sources that matter most to your workflows, enabling Claude to operate within your favorite software and draw insights from the complete context of your external tools. With Custom Connectors, you can: Connect Claude to existing remote MCP servers provided by third-party developers Build your own remote MCP servers to connect with any tool \ud83d\udccc Best Practices for Using Remote MCP Servers: When working with remote MCP servers, consider these recommendations to ensure a secure and efficient experience: Security considerations: Always verify the authenticity of remote MCP servers before connecting. Only connect to servers from trusted sources, and review the permissions requested during authentication. Be cautious about granting access to sensitive data or systems. Managing multiple connectors: You can connect to multiple remote MCP servers simultaneously. Organize your connectors by purpose or project to maintain clarity. Regularly review and remove connectors you no longer use to keep your workspace organized and secure. \ud83d\udccc Build an MCP Server: Core MCP Concepts MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities: Resources: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents) Tools: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval) Prompts: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks System requirements Python 3.10 or higher installed. You must use the Python MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher. # Create a new directory for our project uv init weather cd weather # Create virtual environment and activate it uv venv source . venv / bin / activate # Install dependencies uv add \"mcp[cli]\" httpx # Create server file touch weather . py \ud83d\udccc Building your server: Importing packages and setting up the instance weather.py from typing import Any import httpx from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP # Initialize FastMCP server mcp = FastMCP ( \"weather\" ) # Constants NWS_API_BASE = \"https://api.weather.gov\" USER_AGENT = \"weather-app/1.0\" The FastMCP class uses Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines or software that can simulate human intelligence. \ud83d\udccc Key aspects of AI include: Mimicking human intelligence: The goal of AI is to enable systems to \"think\" and \"act\" like humans, or at least to perform tasks in a way that suggests intelligence. Learning from data: A core part of modern AI is machine learning, where systems are trained on vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Problem-solving: AI systems are designed to solve complex problems by systematically searching through possible actions to reach a desired goal. \ud83d\udccc AI is an umbrella term that encompasses various subfields, such as: Machine Learning (ML): The use of algorithms and data to enable systems to learn and improve over time. Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks inspired by the human brain. Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Computer Vision: Enabling machines to \"see\" and interpret visual information from images and videos. Generative AI: Models that can create new, original content like text, images, or audio. \u2705 What is Machine learning (ML)? Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that empowers computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. Instead of following a rigid set of rules, ML algorithms are trained on vast amounts of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and generate insights. \ud83d\udccc Core component of ML \ud83d\udccc Core concepts of ML Learning from Data: The fundamental idea behind machine learning is that a system can be given a dataset and, through a process of statistical analysis and pattern recognition, it can learn the underlying relationships within that data. The more data it receives, the better it becomes at its task. The Model: The \"brain\" of a machine learning system is the model. This is the piece of software that has been trained on the data. For example, a model trained to predict house prices would have learned the mathematical relationship between factors like location, square footage, and the final sale price. Trial and Error: Machine learning often involves an iterative process. The model makes a prediction, its accuracy is evaluated, and then the model is adjusted to reduce its errors. This cycle of \"evaluate and optimize\" is how the system continuously refines its performance. \ud83d\udccc Types of Machine Learning There are three main types of machine learning. Supervised Learning: This is the most common type. The algorithm is trained on a \"labeled\" dataset, meaning the data includes both the input and the correct output. The model learns to map the input to the output, and once trained, it can predict the output for new, unseen data. Unsupervised Learning: In this case, the algorithm is given \"unlabeled\" data\u2014it has no prior knowledge of the correct outputs. The goal is for the algorithm to discover hidden patterns and structures on its own. Reinforcement Learning: Focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions through trial and error using rewards. \ud83d\udccc Underfitting and Overfitting Machine learning models aim to perform well on both training data and new, unseen data and is considered \"good\" if: It learns patterns effectively from the training data. It generalizes well to new, unseen data. It avoids memorizing the training data (overfitting) or failing to capture relevant patterns (underfitting). To evaluate how well a model learns and generalizes, we monitor its performance on both the training data and a separate validation or test dataset which is often measured by its accuracy or prediction errors . However, achieving this balance can be challenging . Two common issues that affect a model's performance and generalization ability are overfitting and underfitting . These problems are major contributors to poor performance in machine learning models. Let's us understand what they are and how they contribute to ML models. \ud83d\udccc Bias and Variance in Machine Learning Bias and variance are two key sources of error in machine learning models that directly impact their performance and generalization ability. Bias: is the error that happens when a machine learning model is too simple and doesn't learn enough details from the data. It's like assuming all birds can only be small and fly, so the model fails to recognize big birds like ostriches or penguins that can't fly and get biased with predictions. These assumptions make the model easier to train but may prevent it from capturing the underlying complexities of the data. High bias typically leads to underfitting , where the model performs poorly on both training and testing data because it fails to learn enough from the data. Example: A linear regression model applied to a dataset with a non-linear relationship. Variance: Error that happens when a machine learning model learns too much from the data, including random noise. A high-variance model learns not only the patterns but also the noise in the training data, which leads to poor generalization on unseen data. High variance typically leads to overfitting , where the model performs well on training data but poorly on testing data. \ud83d\udccc Overfitting and Underfitting: The Core Issues 1. Overfitting in Machine Learning Overfitting happens when a model learns too much from the training data, including details that don\u2019t matter (like noise or outliers). For example, imagine fitting a very complicated curve to a set of points. The curve will go through every point, but it won\u2019t represent the actual pattern. As a result, the model works great on training data but fails when tested on new data. Overfitting models are like students who memorize answers instead of understanding the topic. They do well in practice tests (training) but struggle in real exams (testing). Reasons for Overfitting: High variance and low bias. The model is too complex. The size of the training data. 2. Underfitting in Machine Learning Underfitting is the opposite of overfitting. It happens when a model is too simple to capture what\u2019s going on in the data. For example, imagine drawing a straight line to fit points that actually follow a curve. The line misses most of the pattern. In this case, the model doesn\u2019t work well on either the training or testing data. Underfitting models are like students who don\u2019t study enough. They don\u2019t do well in practice tests or real exams. Note: The underfitting model has High bias and low variance . Reasons for Underfitting: The model is too simple, So it may be not capable to represent the complexities in the data. The input features which is used to train the model is not the adequate representations of underlying factors influencing the target variable. The size of the training dataset used is not enough. Excessive regularization are used to prevent the overfitting, which constraint the model to capture the data well. Features are not scaled. Let's visually understand the concept of underfitting, proper fitting, and overfitting. Underfitting : Straight line trying to fit a curved dataset but cannot capture the data's patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and test sets. Overfitting: A squiggly curve passing through all training points, failing to generalize performing well on training data but poorly on test data. Appropriate Fitting: Curve that follows the data trend without overcomplicating to capture the true patterns in the data. \ud83d\udccc Balance Between Bias and Variance The relationship between bias and variance is often referred to as the bias-variance tradeoff, which highlights the need for balance: Increasing model complexity reduces bias but increases variance (risk of overfitting). Simplifying the model reduces variance but increases bias (risk of underfitting). The goal is to find an optimal balance where both bias and variance are minimized, resulting in good generalization performance. Imagine you're trying to predict the price of houses based on their size, and you decide to draw a line or curve that best fits the data points on a graph. How well this line captures the trend in the data depends on the complexity of the model you use. When a model is too simple, like fitting a straight line to curved data, it has high bias and fails to capture the true relationship, leading to underfitting . For example, a linear model cannot represent a non-linear increase in house prices with size. However, if the model becomes too complex, like a fourth-degree polynomial that adjusts to every point, it develops high variance , overfits the training data, and struggles to generalize to new data. This is overfitting, where the model performs well on training but poorly on testing. An ideal model strikes a balance with low bias and low variance , capturing the overall pattern without overreacting to noise. For instance, a smooth second-degree polynomial fits the data well without being overly complex. \ud83d\udccc How to Address Overfitting and Underfitting? Underfitting \u2013 Techniques to Reduce Overfitting \u2013 Techniques to Reduce \u2705 Increase model complexity (e.g., deeper trees, more layers). \u2705 Improve the quality of training data to focus on meaningful patterns. \u2705 Increase the number of features, perform feature engineering. \u2705 Increase the training data to improve generalization. \u2705 Remove noise from the data. \u2705 Reduce model complexity (e.g., prune trees, reduce layers). \u2705 Increase the number of epochs or training duration. \u2705 Use early stopping \u2013 stop training when validation loss starts increasing. \u2705 Apply Ridge (L2) or Lasso (L1) regularization. \u2705 Use dropout in neural networks.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"MachineLearning/ReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.html","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"MachineLearning/SupervisedLearning/Classification.html","text":"\u2705 What is Classification in Supervised Learning? Classification is a type of Supervised Learning where the model learns from labeled data to predict discrete categories or classes. Classification teaches a machine to sort things into categories. It learns by looking at examples with labels (like emails marked \"spam\" or \"not spam\"). After learning, it can decide which category new items belong to, like identifying if a new email is spam or not. For example a classification model might be trained on dataset of images labeled as either dogs or cats and it can be used to predict the class of new and unseen images as dogs or cats based on their features such as color, texture and shape. \ud83d\udccc Types of Classification When we talk about classification in machine learning, we\u2019re talking about the process of sorting data into categories based on specific features or characteristics. There are different types of classification problems depending on how many categories (or classes) we are working with and how they are organized. There are two main classification types in machine learning: Binary Classification This is the simplest kind of classification. In binary classification, the goal is to sort the data into two distinct categories . Think of it like a simple choice between two options. Imagine a system that sorts emails into either spam or not spam. It works by looking at different features of the email like certain keywords or sender details, and decides whether it\u2019s spam or not. It only chooses between these two options. Multiclass Classification Here, instead of just two categories, the data needs to be sorted into more than two categories . The model picks the one that best matches the input. Think of an image recognition system that sorts pictures of animals into categories like cat, dog, and bird . Basically, machine looks at the features in the image (like shape, color, or texture) and chooses which animal the picture is most likely to be based on the training it received. \ud83d\udccc Examples of Machine Learning Classification in Real Life Email spam filtering Credit risk assessment: Algorithms predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default by analyzing factors such as credit score, income, and loan history. This helps banks make informed lending decisions and minimize financial risk. Medical diagnosis: Machine learning models classify whether a patient has a certain condition (e.g., cancer or diabetes) based on medical data such as test results, symptoms, and patient history. This aids doctors in making quicker, more accurate diagnoses, improving patient care. Image classification: Applied in fields such as facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical imaging. Sentiment analysis: Determining whether the sentiment of a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. Businesses use this to understand customer opinions, helping to improve products and services. Fraud detection: Algorithms detect fraudulent activities by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies crucial in protecting against credit card fraud and other financial crimes. Recommendation systems: Used to recommend products or content based on past user behavior, such as suggesting movies on Netflix or products on Amazon. This personalization boosts user satisfaction and sales for businesses. \ud83d\udccc Key characteristics of Classification Models Class Separation: Classification relies on distinguishing between distinct classes. The goal is to learn a model that can separate or categorize data points into predefined classes based on their features. Decision Boundaries: The model draws decision boundaries in the feature space to differentiate between classes. These boundaries can be linear or non-linear. Sensitivity to Data Quality: Classification models are sensitive to the quality and quantity of the training data. Well-labeled, representative data ensures better performance, while noisy or biased data can lead to poor predictions. Handling Imbalanced Data: Classification problems may face challenges when one class is underrepresented. Special techniques like resampling or weighting are used to handle class imbalances. Interpretability: Some classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, offer higher interpretability, meaning it's easier to understand why a model made a particular prediction. \ud83d\udccc Classification Algorithms Now, for implementation of any classification model it is essential to understand Logistic Regression , which is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in machine learning for classification tasks. There are various types of classifiers algorithms . Some of them are : Linear Classifiers: Linear classifier models create a linear decision boundary between classes. They are simple and computationally efficient. Some of the linear classification models are as follows: Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines having kernel = 'linear' Single-layer Perceptron Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier Non-linear Classifiers: Non-linear models create a non-linear decision boundary between classes. They can capture more complex relationships between input features and target variable. Some of the non-linear classification models are as follows: K-Nearest Neighbours Kernel SVM Naive Bayes Decision Tree Classification Random Forests AdaBoost Bagging Classifier Voting Classifier Extra Trees Classifier Multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks \ud83d\udccc Logistic Regression in Machine Learning Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class. It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False or 0/1. It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1. \ud83d\udccc Types of Logistic Regression Logistic regression can be classified into three main types based on the nature of the dependent variable: Binomial Logistic Regression: This type is used when the dependent variable has only two possible categories. Examples include Yes/No, Pass/Fail or 0/1. It is the most common form of logistic regression and is used for binary classification problems. Multinomial Logistic Regression: This is used when the dependent variable has three or more possible categories that are not ordered. For example, classifying animals into categories like \"cat,\" \"dog\" or \"sheep.\" It extends the binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes. Ordinal Logistic Regression: This type applies when the dependent variable has three or more categories with a natural order or ranking. Examples include ratings like \"low,\" \"medium\" and \"high.\" It takes the order of the categories into account when modeling. \ud83d\udccc Assumptions of Logistic Regression Understanding the assumptions behind logistic regression is important to ensure the model is applied correctly, main assumptions are: Independent observations: Each data point is assumed to be independent of the others means there should be no correlation or dependence between the input samples. Binary dependent variables: It takes the assumption that the dependent variable must be binary, means it can take only two values. For more than two categories SoftMax functions are used. Linearity relationship between independent variables and log odds: The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of the dependent variable which means the predictors affect the log odds in a linear way. No outliers: The dataset should not contain extreme outliers as they can distort the estimation of the logistic regression coefficients. Large sample size: It requires a sufficiently large sample size to produce reliable and stable results. \ud83d\udccc Understanding Sigmoid Function The sigmoid function is a important part of logistic regression which is used to convert the raw output of the model into a probability value between 0 and 1. This function takes any real number and maps it into the range 0 to 1 forming an \"S\" shaped curve called the sigmoid curve or logistic curve. Because probabilities must lie between 0 and 1, the sigmoid function is perfect for this purpose. In logistic regression, we use a threshold value usually 0.5 to decide the class label. If the sigmoid output is same or above the threshold, the input is classified as Class 1. If it is below the threshold, the input is classified as Class 0. \ud83d\udccc How does Logistic Regression work? The logit function is commonly used in Logistic Regression , especially when working with binary classification problems. It maps probabilities (values between 0 and 1) to real numbers (\u2212\u221e to +\u221e). Here's a full explanation and example of how it works: \ud83d\udccc What is the logit function? The logit function is defined as: Logistic Function (Sigmoid) The inverse of the logit function is the sigmoid function: \ud83d\udccc How to Evaluate Logistic Regression Model? \ud83d\udccc Differences Between Linear and Logistic Regression?

The value ranges from: +1 \u2192 perfect positive correlation (as one increases, so does the other) 0 \u2192 no correlation \u20131 \u2192 perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases) \ud83d\udccc How to Read a Correlation Heatmap import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 8 )) sns . heatmap ( df . corr (), annot = True , cmap = 'coolwarm' , fmt = \".2f\" ) plt . title ( \"Correlation Heatmap\" ) plt . show () Element Description df.corr() Calculates pairwise correlation between all numerical columns. annot=True Shows the correlation coefficient numbers in each cell. cmap='coolwarm' Color map; red = high positive correlation, blue = high negative. fmt=\".2f\" Shows values up to 2 decimal places. \ud83d\udccc What to Look for in Heatmaps Goal Example \ud83d\udd0d Identify multicollinearity If two features have correlation > 0.9 or < \u20130.9, one can be removed. \ud83c\udfaf Target association Look for features highly correlated with the target variable ( Outcome ). \ud83e\uddfc Data cleaning Helps identify redundant variables. \ud83d\udccc Example Interpretation Feature 1 Feature 2 Correlation Interpretation Glucose Outcome 0.47 Moderate positive correlation \u2013 higher glucose relates to diabetes BMI Outcome 0.31 Slight positive correlation Age Pregnancies 0.54 Older individuals tend to have more pregnancies in the dataset \ud83d\udccc Example Output of Correlation with Outcome Correlation with Outcome Feature Correlation with Outcome Glucose 0.47 \u2705 BMI 0.31 \u2705 Age 0.23 \u2705 DiabetesPedigreeFunction 0.17 \u2705 Pregnancies 0.22 SkinThickness 0.07 BloodPressure 0.06 Insulin 0.13 Outcome 1.00 (self) Correlation with Age Feature Correlation with Age Pregnancies 0.54 \u2705 Glucose 0.26 \u2705 BloodPressure 0.24 \u2705 Outcome 0.24 \u2705 BMI 0.036 Age 1.00 (self) DiabetesPedigreeFunction 0.034 SkinThickness - 0.11 \u2705 Insulin - 0.042 \ud83d\udccc Key Insights Glucose has the strongest positive correlation with diabetes.

Cross-validation is a technique used to check how well a machine learning model performs on unseen data. It splits the data into several parts, trains the model on some parts and tests it on the remaining part repeating this process multiple times. Finally the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more accurate estimate of the model's performance. The main purpose of cross validation is to prevent overfitting . If you want to make sure your machine learning model is not just memorizing the training data but is capable of adapting to real-world data cross-validation is a commonly used technique. In scikit-learn a random split into training and test sets can be quickly computed with the train_test_split helper function. Let\u2019s load the iris data set to fit a linear support vector machine on it: import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn import datasets from sklearn import svm X , y = datasets . load_iris ( return_X_y = True ) X . shape , y . shape We can now quickly sample a training set while holding out 40% of the data for testing (evaluating) our classifier: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=0) X_train.shape, y_train.shape X_test.shape, y_test.shape clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1).fit(X_train, y_train) clf.score(X_test, y_test) \ud83d\udd39 What is C in SVM? # C is the regularization parameter in SVM. It controls the trade-off between: Having a wide margin (simpler model, better generalization) Classifying training points correctly (lower training error) \ud83d\udd38 Intuition (Margin vs Misclassification) # Large C (e.g., C=1000): The model tries very hard to classify all training points correctly. Narrow margin , less tolerance for misclassification. Risk of overfitting (memorizes training data, may fail on unseen data). Small C (e.g., C=0.01): The model allows some misclassifications . Wider margin, focuses more on generalization. Risk of underfitting (too simple, misses patterns). When evaluating different settings (\u201chyperparameters\u201d) for estimators, such as the C setting that must be manually set for an SVM, there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can \u201cleak\u201d into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance.To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called \u201cvalidation set\u201d: training proceeds on the training set, after which evaluation is done on the validation set, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set. However, by partitioning the available data into three sets, we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets. A solution to this problem is a procedure called cross-validation (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k \u201cfolds\u201d: A model is trained using k -1 of the folds as training data; the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy). The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary validation set), which is a major advantage in problems such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small. Computing cross-validated metrics # The simplest way to use cross-validation is to call the cross_val_score helper function on the estimator and the dataset. The following example demonstrates how to estimate the accuracy of a linear kernel support vector machine on the iris dataset by splitting the data, fitting a model and computing the score 5 consecutive times (with different splits each time): from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score clf = svm . SVC ( kernel = 'linear' , C = 1 , random_state = 42 ) scores = cross_val_score ( clf , X , y , cv = 5 ) scores The mean score and the standard deviation are hence given by: print(\"%0.2f accuracy with a standard deviation of %0.2f\" % (scores.mean(), scores.std())) 0.98 accuracy with a standard deviation of 0.02 By default, the score computed at each CV iteration is the score method of the estimator. It is possible to change this by using the scoring parameter: from sklearn import metrics scores = cross_val_score ( clf , X , y , cv = 5 , scoring = 'f1_macro' ) scores String name scorers # Scikit-learn Scoring Reference # Classification # Scoring String Name Function Comment accuracy metrics.accuracy_score balanced_accuracy metrics.balanced_accuracy_score top_k_accuracy metrics.top_k_accuracy_score average_precision metrics.average_precision_score neg_brier_score metrics.brier_score_loss f1 metrics.f1_score for binary targets f1_micro metrics.f1_score micro-averaged f1_macro metrics.f1_score macro-averaged f1_weighted metrics.f1_score weighted average f1_samples metrics.f1_score by multilabel sample neg_log_loss metrics.log_loss requires predict_proba support precision , etc. metrics.precision_score suffixes apply as with f1 recall , etc. metrics.recall_score suffixes apply as with f1 jaccard , etc. metrics.jaccard_score suffixes apply as with f1 roc_auc metrics.roc_auc_score roc_auc_ovr metrics.roc_auc_score roc_auc_ovo metrics.roc_auc_score roc_auc_ovr_weighted metrics.roc_auc_score roc_auc_ovo_weighted metrics.roc_auc_score d2_log_loss_score metrics.d2_log_loss_score Clustering # Scoring String Name Function Comment adjusted_mutual_info_score metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score adjusted_rand_score metrics.adjusted_rand_score completeness_score metrics.completeness_score fowlkes_mallows_score metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score homogeneity_score metrics.homogeneity_score mutual_info_score metrics.mutual_info_score normalized_mutual_info_score metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score rand_score metrics.rand_score v_measure_score metrics.v_measure_score Regression # Scoring String Name Function Comment explained_variance metrics.explained_variance_score neg_max_error metrics.max_error neg_mean_absolute_error metrics.mean_absolute_error neg_mean_squared_error metrics.mean_squared_error neg_root_mean_squared_error metrics.root_mean_squared_error neg_mean_squared_log_error metrics.mean_squared_log_error neg_root_mean_squared_log_error metrics.root_mean_squared_log_error neg_median_absolute_error metrics.median_absolute_error r2 metrics.r2_score neg_mean_poisson_deviance metrics.mean_poisson_deviance neg_mean_gamma_deviance metrics.mean_gamma_deviance neg_mean_absolute_percentage_error metrics.mean_absolute_percentage_error d2_absolute_error_score metrics.d2_absolute_error_score In the case of the Iris dataset, the samples are balanced across target classes hence the accuracy and the F1-score are almost equal. When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default It is also possible to use other cross validation strategies by passing a cross validation iterator instead, for instance: from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit n_samples = X . shape [ 0 ] cv = ShuffleSplit ( n_splits = 5 , test_size = 0.3 , random_state = 0 ) cross_val_score ( clf , X , y , cv = cv ) \ud83d\udccc Types of Cross-Validation There are several types of cross validation techniques which are as follows: 1. Holdout Validation In Holdout Validation we perform training on the 50% of the given dataset and rest 50% is used for the testing purpose. It's a simple and quick way to evaluate a model. The major drawback of this method is that we perform training on the 50% of the dataset, it may possible that the remaining 50% of the data contains some important information which we are leaving while training our model that can lead to higher bias. Process: Split dataset into training and test sets (commonly 70:30 or 80:20). Pros: Simple, fast. Cons: High variance (depends heavily on split). When to use: Very large datasets where k-fold isn\u2019t necessary. 2. LOOCV (Leave One Out Cross Validation) In this method we perform training on the whole dataset but leaves only one data-point of the available dataset and then iterates for each data-point. In LOOCV the model is trained on n\u22121 samples and tested on the one omitted sample repeating this process for each data point in the dataset. It has some advantages as well as disadvantages also. An advantage of using this method is that we make use of all data points and hence it is low bias. The major drawback of this method is that it leads to higher variation in the testing model as we are testing against one data point. If the data point is an outlier it can lead to higher variation. Another drawback is it takes a lot of execution time as it iterates over the number of data points we have. Process: k = number of samples. Train on all except one sample, test on the one sample. Repeat for each sample. Pros: Almost unbiased performance estimate. Cons: Extremely computationally expensive for large datasets; can have high variance. 3. Stratified Cross-Validation It is a technique used in machine learning to ensure that each fold of the cross-validation process maintains the same class distribution as the entire dataset. This is particularly important when dealing with imbalanced datasets where certain classes may be under represented. In this method: The dataset is divided into k folds while maintaining the proportion of classes in each fold. During each iteration, one-fold is used for testing and the remaining folds are used for training. The process is repeated k times with each fold serving as the test set exactly once. Stratified Cross-Validation is essential when dealing with classification problems where maintaining the balance of class distribution is crucial for the model to generalize well to unseen data. 4. K-Fold Cross Validation In K-Fold Cross Validation we split the dataset into k number of subsets known as folds then we perform training on the all the subsets but leave one (k-1) subset for the evaluation of the trained model. In this method, we iterate k times with a different subset reserved for testing purpose each time. Note: It is always suggested that the value of k should be 10 as the lower value of k takes towards validation and higher value of k leads to LOOCV method. Example of K Fold Cross Validation The diagram below shows an example of the training subsets and evaluation subsets generated in k-fold cross-validation. Here we have total 25 instances. In first iteration we use the first 20 percent of data for evaluation and the remaining 80 percent for training like [1-5] testing and [5-25] training while in the second iteration we use the second subset of 20 percent for evaluation and the remaining three subsets of the data for training like [5-10] testing and [1-5 and 10-25] training and so on. Iteration Training Set Observations Testing Set Observations 1 [5-24] [0-4] 2 [0-4, 10-24] [5-9] 3 [0-9, 15-24] [10-14] 4 [0-14, 20-24] [15-19] 5 [0-19] [20-24] Each iteration uses different subsets for testing and training, ensuring that all data points are used for both training and testing. 5. Time Series Cross-Validation (Rolling/Expanding Window) Process: Train on first chunk, validate on next chunk. Move the window forward in time. Pros: Preserves temporal order, avoids leakage from future. Cons: Less training data in early folds. Use case: Forecasting, stock prices, sensor data. \ud83d\udccc Comparison between K-Fold Cross-Validation and Hold Out Method K-Fold Cross-Validation and Hold Out Method are widely used technique and sometimes they are confusing so here is the quick comparison between them: Feature K-Fold Cross-Validation Hold-Out Method Definition The dataset is divided into 'k' subsets (folds). Each fold gets a turn to be the test set while the others are used for training. The dataset is split into two sets: one for training and one for testing. Training Sets \u2705 The model is trained 'k' times, each time on a different training subset. \u26a0\ufe0f The model is trained once on the training set. Testing Sets \u2705 The model is tested 'k' times, each time on a different test subset. \u26a0\ufe0f The model is tested once on the test set. Bias \u2705 Less biased due to multiple splits and testing. \u274c Can have higher bias due to a single split. Variance \u2705 Lower variance, as it tests on multiple splits. \u274c Higher variance, as results depend on the single split. Computation Cost \u274c High, as the model is trained and tested 'k' times. \u2705 Low, as the model is trained and tested only once. Use in Model Selection \u2705 Better for tuning and evaluating model performance due to reduced bias. \u274c Less reliable for model selection, as it might give inconsistent results. Data Utilization \u2705 The entire dataset is used for both training and testing. \u274c Only a portion of the data is used for testing, so some data is not used for validation. Suitability for Small Datasets \u2705 Preferred for small datasets, as it maximizes data usage. \u274c Less ideal for small datasets, as a significant portion is held out for testing. Risk of Overfitting \u2705 Less prone to overfitting due to multiple training and testing cycles. \u274c Higher risk of overfitting as the model is trained on one set. \ud83d\udccc Advantages and Disadvantages of Cross Validation Advantages: Overcoming Overfitting: Cross validation helps to prevent overfitting by providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. Model Selection: Cross validation is used to compare different models and select the one that performs the best on average. Hyperparameter tuning: This is used to optimize the hyperparameters of a model such as the regularization parameter by selecting the values that result in the best performance on the validation set. Data Efficient: It allow the use of all the available data for both training and validation making it more data-efficient method compared to traditional validation techniques. Disadvantages: Computationally Expensive: It can be computationally expensive especially when the number of folds is large or when the model is complex and requires a long time to train. Time-Consuming: It can be time-consuming especially when there are many hyperparameters to tune or when multiple models need to be compared. Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The choice of the number of folds in cross validation can impact the bias-variance tradeoff i.e too few folds may result in high bias while too many folds may result in high variance. \ud83d\udccc Python implementation for k fold cross-validation Step 1: Importing necessary libraries import from scikit learn. from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score , KFold from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.datasets import load_iris Step 2: Loading the dataset let's use the iris dataset which is a multi-class classification in-built dataset. iris = load_iris () X , y = iris . data , iris . target Step 3: Creating SVM classifier SVC is a Support Vector Classification model from scikit-learn. svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='linear') Step 4: Defining the number of folds for cross-validation Here we will be using 5 folds. num_folds = 5 kf = KFold(n_splits=num_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=42) Step 5: Performing k-fold cross-validation cross_val_results = cross_val_score(svm_classifier, X, y, cv=kf) Step 6: Evaluation metrics print ( \"Cross-Validation Results (Accuracy):\" ) for i , result in enumerate ( cross_val_results , 1 ): print ( f \" Fold {i}: {result * 100:.2f}%\" ) print ( f 'Mean Accuracy: {cross_val_results.mean()* 100:.2f}%' ) The output shows the accuracy scores from each of the 5 folds in the K-fold cross-validation process. The mean accuracy is the average of these individual scores which is approximately 97.33% indicating the model's overall performance across all the folds.","title":"Cross Validation"},{"location":"MachineLearning/SupervisedLearning/CrossValidation.html#what-is-c-in-svm","text":"C is the regularization parameter in SVM.

In scikit-learn they are passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Typical examples include C , kernel and gamma for Support Vector Classifier, alpha for Lasso, etc. It is possible and recommended to search the hyper-parameter space for the best cross validation score. Any parameter provided when constructing an estimator may be optimized in this manner. Specifically, to find the names and current values for all parameters for a given estimator, use: estimator.get_params() What is an Estimator in Machine Learning? In scikit-learn (and generally in ML), an estimator is any object that can learn from data . It must implement at least the methods: .fit(X, y) \u2192 learns from the data (training). .predict(X) \u2192 makes predictions on new data. \ud83d\udc49 In simple words: An estimator = algorithm/model or transformer in sklearn. A search consists of: an estimator (regressor or classifier such as sklearn.svm.SVC() ); a parameter space; a method for searching or sampling candidates; a cross-validation scheme; a score function. Two generic approaches to parameter search are provided in scikit-learn: for given values, GridSearchCV exhaustively considers all parameter combinations. RandomizedSearchCV can sample a given number of candidates from a parameter space with a specified distribution. Both these tools have successive halving counterparts HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV , which can be much faster at finding a good parameter combination. \ud83d\udccc What is Hyperparameter Tuning? Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the optimal values for a machine learning model's hyperparameters. These are typically set before the actual training process begins and control aspects of the learning process itself. They influence the model's performance its complexity and how fast it learns. For example the learning rate and number of neurons in a neural network in a neural network or the kernel size in a support vector machine can significantly impact how well the model trains and generalizes. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the values that lead to the best performance on a given task. These settings can affect both the speed and quality of the model's performance. A high learning rate can cause the model to converge too quickly possibly skipping over the optimal solution. A low learning rate might lead to slower convergence and require more time and computational resources. Different models have different hyperparameters and they need to be tuned accordingly. \ud83d\udccc Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning Models can have many hyperparameters and finding the best combination of parameters can be treated as a search problem. The two best strategies for Hyperparameter tuning are: \ud83d\udccc 1. GridSearchCV GridSearchCV is a brute-force technique for hyperparameter tuning. It trains the model using all possible combinations of specified hyperparameter values to find the best-performing setup. It is slow and uses a lot of computer power which makes it hard to use with big datasets or many settings. It works using below steps: Create a grid of potential values for each hyperparameter. Train the model for every combination in the grid. Evaluate each model using cross-validation. Select the combination that gives the highest score. For example if we want to tune two hyperparameters C and Alpha for a Logistic Regression Classifier model with the following sets of values: C = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] Alpha = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0] The grid search technique will construct multiple versions of the model with all possible combinations of C and Alpha, resulting in a total of 5 * 4 = 20 different models. The best-performing combination is then chosen. Example: Tuning Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV The following code illustrates how to use GridSearchCV . In this below code: We generate sample data using make_classification . We define a range of C values using logarithmic scale. GridSearchCV tries all combinations from param_grid and uses 5-fold cross-validation. It returns the best hyperparameter (C) and its corresponding validation score from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification X , y = make_classification ( n_samples = 1000 , n_features = 20 , n_informative = 10 , n_classes = 2 , random_state = 42 ) c_space = np . logspace ( - 5 , 8 , 15 ) param_grid = { 'C' : c_space } logreg = LogisticRegression () logreg_cv = GridSearchCV ( logreg , param_grid , cv = 5 ) logreg_cv . fit ( X , y ) print ( \"Tuned Logistic Regression Parameters: {} \" . format ( logreg_cv . best_params_ )) print ( \"Best score is {} \" . format ( logreg_cv . best_score_ )) Output: Tuned Logistic Regression Parameters: {'C': 0.006105402296585327} Best score is 0.853 This represents the highest accuracy achieved by the model using the hyperparameter combination C = 0.0061 . The best score of 0.853 means the model achieved 85.3% accuracy on the validation data during the grid search process. GridSearchCV is a method in scikit-learn that helps you find the best combination of hyperparameters for your model. Takes a model and a set of hyperparameters to try (the \"grid\"). Trains the model with all possible combinations of those hyperparameters. Uses cross-validation to evaluate each combination. Selects the combination that gives the best performance . Why Use It? Choosing hyperparameters manually can be guesswork. GridSearchCV ensures systematic , exhaustive search across given parameter ranges. Helps in avoiding underfitting or overfitting due to poor hyperparameter selection. \ud83d\udccc 3. Real-Time Example: Predicting Loan Default Imagine you\u2019re working in a bank\u2019s credit risk department . You want to predict whether a customer will default on their loan using a Random Forest Classifier. The challenge: The model has multiple hyperparameters ( n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split ). You don\u2019t know the best combination. from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import classification_report # 1. Create synthetic dataset (Example: Loan Default) X , y = make_classification ( n_samples = 1000 , n_features = 10 , n_informative = 5 , n_classes = 2 , random_state = 42 ) # 2. Split into train & test X_train , X_test , y_train , y_test = train_test_split ( X , y , test_size = 0.2 , random_state = 42 ) # 3. Define model rf = RandomForestClassifier ( random_state = 42 ) # 4. Define parameter grid param_grid = { 'n_estimators' : [ 50 , 100 , 200 ], 'max_depth' : [ None , 5 , 10 ], 'min_samples_split' : [ 2 , 5 , 10 ] } # 5. Setup GridSearchCV grid_search = GridSearchCV ( estimator = rf , param_grid = param_grid , cv = 5 , # 5-fold cross-validation scoring = 'accuracy' , # Metric to evaluate n_jobs =- 1 ) # Use all CPU cores # 6. Fit model grid_search . fit ( X_train , y_train ) # 7. Print best parameters & score print ( \"Best Parameters:\" , grid_search . best_params_ ) print ( \"Best Cross-Validation Score:\" , grid_search . best_score_ ) # 8. Evaluate on test data best_model = grid_search . best_estimator_ y_pred = best_model . predict ( X_test ) print ( classification_report ( y_test , y_pred )) How it works in this example Parameter Grid: n_estimators \u2192 [50, 100, 200] max_depth \u2192 [None, 5, 10] min_samples_split \u2192 [2, 5, 10] \u2192 Total combinations = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 27 models. Cross-validation: For each combination, GridSearchCV: Splits training data into 5 folds . Trains on 4 folds, validates on 1. Repeats 5 times \u2192 averages accuracy. Selection: Picks the combination with the highest average validation accuracy. \ud83d\udccc RandomizedSearchCV As the name suggests RandomizedSearchCV picks random combinations of hyperparameters from the given ranges instead of checking every single combination like GridSearchCV. In each iteration it tries a new random combination of hyperparameter values. It records the model\u2019s performance for each combination. After several attempts it selects the best-performing set . Example: Tuning Decision Tree with RandomizedSearchCV The following code illustrates how to use RandomizedSearchCV.In this example: We define a range of values for each hyperparameter e.g, max_depth , min_samples_leaf etc. Random combinations are picked and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The best combination and score are printed. import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification X , y = make_classification ( n_samples = 1000 , n_features = 20 , n_informative = 10 , n_classes = 2 , random_state = 42 ) from scipy.stats import randint from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV param_dist = { \"max_depth\" : [ 3 , None ], \"max_features\" : randint ( 1 , 9 ), \"min_samples_leaf\" : randint ( 1 , 9 ), \"criterion\" : [ \"gini\" , \"entropy\" ] } tree = DecisionTreeClassifier () tree_cv = RandomizedSearchCV ( tree , param_dist , cv = 5 ) tree_cv . fit ( X , y ) print ( \"Tuned Decision Tree Parameters: {} \" . format ( tree_cv . best_params_ )) print ( \"Best score is {} \" . format ( tree_cv . best_score_ )) Output: Tuned Decision Tree Parameters: {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 6, 'min_samples_leaf': 6} Best score is 0.8 A score of 0.842 means the model performed with an accuracy of 84.2% on the validation set with following hyperparameters. \ud83d\udccc Advantages of Hyperparameter tuning Improved Model Performance: Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can significantly boost model accuracy and robustness. Reduced Overfitting and Underfitting: Tuning helps to prevent both overfitting and underfitting resulting in a well-balanced model. Enhanced Model Generalizability: By selecting hyperparameters that optimize performance on validation data the model is more likely to generalize well to unseen data. Optimized Resource Utilization: With careful tuning resources such as computation time and memory can be used more efficiently avoiding unnecessary work. Improved Model Interpretability: Properly tuned hyperparameters can make the model simpler and easier to interpret. \ud83d\udccc Challenges in Hyperparameter Tuning Dealing with High-Dimensional Hyperparameter Spaces: The larger the hyperparameter space the more combinations need to be explored. This makes the search process computationally expensive and time-consuming especially for complex models with many hyperparameters. Handling Expensive Function Evaluations: Evaluating a model's performance can be computationally expensive, particularly for models that require a lot of data or iterations. Incorporating Domain Knowledge: It can help guide the hyperparameter search, narrowing down the search space and making the process more efficient. Using insights from the problem context can improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of tuning. Developing Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning Methods: Dynamic adjustment of hyperparameters during training such as learning rate schedules or early stopping can lead to better model performance.","title":"Hyperparameter Tuning"},{"location":"MachineLearning/SupervisedLearning/Overview.html","text":"\u2705 What is Supervised Machine Learning? supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data\u2014meaning each input is paired with the correct output. the model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers provided in the training data. Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions when given new, unseen data. Supervised learning can be applied in various forms, including supervised learning classification and supervised learning regression \ud83d\udccc How Supervised Machine Learning Works? Where supervised learning algorithm consists of input features and corresponding output labels . The process works through the following stages: Training Data: The model is provided with a training dataset. This dataset is the foundation of the learning process and consists of: Input Features: The variables or attributes used to make a prediction. Output Labels: The correct answers or target variables corresponding to the input features. Learning Process: The supervised learning algorithm processes the training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels. This is achieved by: Initialization: The model's parameters are randomly initialized. Prediction: The model makes a prediction for a given input. Error Calculation: The model's prediction is compared to the actual label. The difference between these two is the error. Parameter Adjustment: The model's parameters are adjusted to minimize this error. This process is repeated iteratively over the entire training dataset until the model's performance on the training data is optimized. Validation Data: This is a crucial step to prevent overfitting. The validation set is a portion of the original data that is set aside and not used during the initial training process. It is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and assess its performance during the training phase. By evaluating the model on the validation data, we can see if it is learning generalized patterns or simply memorizing the training data. Test Data: After the model has been trained and its hyperparameters have been tuned using the validation set, it is evaluated one last time using a separate, unseen test dataset. The test dataset is the ultimate measure of the model\u2019s accuracy and performance. Because the model has never seen this data before, the results on the test set provide an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on new, real-world data. Training phase involves feeding the algorithm labeled data, where each data point is paired with its correct output. The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships between the input and output data. Testing phase involves feeding the algorithm new, unseen data and evaluating its ability to predict the correct output based on the learned patterns. \ud83d\udccc Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning? Classification: Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no). Regression: Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices). While training the model, data is usually split in the ratio of 80:20 i.e. 80% as training data and the rest 20% as testing data . In training data, we feed input as well as output for 80% of data. The model learns from training data only. Understand the classification and regression data Both the above figures have labelled data set as follows: Figure A: It is a dataset of a shopping store that is useful in predicting whether a customer will purchase a particular product under consideration or not based on his/ her gender, age, and salary. Input: Gender, Age, Salary Output: Purchased i.e. 0 or 1 ; 1 means yes the customer will purchase and 0 means that the customer won't purchase it. Figure B: It is a Meteorological dataset that serves the purpose of predicting wind speed based on different parameters. Input: Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Direction Output: Wind Speed \ud83d\udccc Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms Linear Regression: Linear regression is a type of supervised learning regression algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output value. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable. Decision Trees: Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome. Random Forests: Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest. Support Vector Machine(SVM): The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity. Gradient Boosting: Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones. Naive Bayes Algorithm: The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the \u201cnaive\u201d assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label. \ud83d\udccc Training a Supervised Learning Model Key Steps: Data Collection and Preprocessing(cleaning, feature engineering): Gather a labeled dataset consisting of input features and target output labels. Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features as needed to ensure high quality for supervised learning algorithms. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the first step in the data analysis process. It involves visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset to understand its structure, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. Splitting the Data: Divide the data into training set (80%) and the test set (20%). Choosing the Model: Select appropriate algorithms based on the problem type. This step is crucial for effective supervised learning in AI. Training the Model: Feed the model input data and output labels, allowing it to learn patterns by adjusting internal parameters. Evaluating the Model: Test the trained model on the unseen test set and assess its performance using various metrics. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust settings that control the training process (e.g., learning rate) using techniques like grid search and cross-validation. Final Testing: Retrain the model on the complete dataset using the best hyperparameters testing its performance on the test set to ensure readiness for deployment. Model Deployment: Deploy the validated model to make predictions on new, unseen data. \ud83d\udccc Advantages of Supervised Learning: The power of supervised learning lies in its ability to accurately predict patterns and make data-driven decisions across a variety of applications. Here are some advantages of supervised learning listed below: Supervised learning excels in accurately predicting patterns and making data-driven decisions. Labeled training data is crucial for enabling supervised learning models to learn input-output relationships effectively. Supervised machine learning encompasses tasks such as supervised learning classification and supervised learning regression . Applications include complex problems like image recognition and natural language processing. Established evaluation metrics ( accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score ) are essential for assessing supervised learning model performance. Advantages of supervised learning include creating complex models for accurate predictions on new data. \ud83d\udccc Disadvantages of Supervised Learning: Despite the benefits of supervised learning methods , there are notable disadvantages of supervised learning : Overfitting: Models can overfit training data, leading to poor performance on new data due to capturing noise in supervised machine learning . Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features is crucial but can be time-consuming and requires domain expertise in supervised learning applications . Bias in Models: Bias in the training data may result in unfair predictions in supervised learning algorithms . Dependence on Labeled Data: Supervised learning relies heavily on labeled training data, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain, posing a challenge for supervised learning techniques. \ud83d\udccc Conclusion: Supervised learning is a powerful branch of machine learning that revolves around learning a class from examples provided during training. By using supervised learning algorithms, models can be trained to make predictions based on labeled data. The effectiveness of supervised machine learning lies in its ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data, making it invaluable for a variety of applications, from image recognition to financial forecasting. Understanding the types of supervised learning algorithms and the dimensions of supervised machine learning is essential for choosing the appropriate algorithm to solve specific problems. As we continue to explore the different types of supervised learning and refine these supervised learning techniques, the impact of supervised learning in machine learning will only grow, playing a critical role in advancing AI-driven solutions.

It finds relationships between variables so that predictions can be made. we have two types of variables present in regression: Dependent Variable (Target): The variable we are trying to predict e.g house price. Independent Variables (Features): The input variables that influence the prediction e.g locality, number of rooms. Regression analysis problem works with if output variable is a real or continuous value such as \u201csalary\u201d or \u201cweight\u201d. Many different regression models can be used but the simplest model in them is linear regression. \ud83d\udccc Types of Regression Regression can be classified into different types based on the number of predictor variables and the nature of the relationship between variables: 1. Simple Linear Regression Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical models. This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. For example predicting the price of a house based on its size. 2. Multiple Linear Regression Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict target variable. For example predicting the price of a house based on multiple features such as size, location, number of rooms, etc. 3. Polynomial Regression Polynomial regression is used to model with non-linear relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables. It adds polynomial terms to the linear regression model to capture more complex relationships. For example when we want to predict a non-linear trend like population growth over time we use polynomial regression. 4. Ridge & Lasso Regression Ridge & lasso regression are regularized versions of linear regression that help avoid overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. When there\u2019s a risk of overfitting due to too many features we use these type of regression algorithms. 5. Support Vector Regression (SVR) SVR is a type of regression algorithm that is based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a type of algorithm that is used for classification tasks but it can also be used for regression tasks. SVR works by finding a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. 6. Decision Tree Regression Decision tree Uses a tree-like structure to make decisions where each branch of tree represents a decision and leaves represent outcomes. For example predicting customer behavior based on features like age, income, etc there we use decison tree regression. 7. Random Forest Regression Random Forest is a ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all of the trees. For example customer churn or sales data using this. \ud83d\udccc Regression Evaluation Metrics Evaluation in machine learning measures the performance of a model. Here are some popular evaluation metrics for regression: Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the mean squared error. R2 \u2013 Score: Higher values indicate better fit ranging from 0 to 1. \ud83d\udccc What is Mean Absolute Error (MAE)? Mean Absolute Error calculates the average difference between the calculated values and actual values. It is also known as scale-dependent accuracy as it calculates error in observations taken on the same scale used to predict the accuracy of the machine learning model. MAE Formula: \u2705 Real-Life Example Suppose we are predicting house prices. You have the actual prices and predicted prices for 5 houses: House Actual Price (in Lakhs) Predicted Price (in Lakhs) A 50 48 B 60 65 C 55 53 D 70 75 E 65 60 \ud83e\uddee Step-by-Step Calculation Calculate the absolute error for each: |50 - 48| = 2 |60 - 65| = 5 |55 - 53| = 2 |70 - 75| = 5 |65 - 60| = 5 Sum of absolute errors: 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 19 Number of predictions = 5 Calculate MAE: MAE= 19/5 = 3.8 Interpretation: The MAE = 3.8 Lakhs On average, your model\u2019s predictions are off by 3.8 Lakhs from the actual prices. \ud83d\udccc Python Code Example: from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error actual = [ 50 , 60 , 55 , 70 , 65 ] predicted = [ 48 , 65 , 53 , 75 , 60 ] mae = mean_absolute_error ( actual , predicted ) print ( \"MAE:\" , mae ) \ud83d\udccc What is Mean Squared Error (MSE)? Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a commonly used regression error metric that measures the average squared difference between the actual values and the predicted values. \u2705 Real-Life Example House Actual Price (Lakhs) Predicted Price (Lakhs) A 50 48 B 60 65 C 55 53 D 70 75 E 65 60 \ud83e\uddee Step-by-Step Calculation Calculate squared errors: (50 - 48)^2 = 4 (60 - 65)^2 = 25 (55 - 53)^2 = 4 (70 - 75)^2 = 25 (65 - 60)^2 = 25 Sum of squared errors: 4 + 25 + 4 + 25 + 25 = 83 Number of samples = 5 Calculate MSE: MSE = 83/5 = 16.6 Interpretation: MSE = 16.6 On average, the squared difference between predicted and actual values is 16.6. Higher errors are penalized more because the error is squared. Python Code from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Actual and Predicted values actual = [ 50 , 60 , 55 , 70 , 65 ] predicted = [ 48 , 65 , 53 , 75 , 60 ] # Calculate MSE using scikit-learn mse = mean_squared_error ( actual , predicted ) print ( \"Mean Squared Error (MSE):\" , mse ) \ud83d\udccc What is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)? Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a standard regression metric that measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. It is the square root of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and brings the error back to the same unit as the target variable, making it easier to interpret. \u2705 Real-Life Example House Actual Price (Lakhs) Predicted Price (Lakhs) A 50 48 B 60 65 C 55 53 D 70 75 E 65 60 \ud83e\uddee Step-by-Step Calculation (50 - 48)^2 = 4 (60 - 65)^2 = 25 (55 - 53)^2 = 4 (70 - 75)^2 = 25 (65 - 60)^2 = 25 Interpretation RMSE = 4.08 Lakhs On average, your model's predictions are off by about 4.08 Lakhs. Since RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily (due to squaring), it's useful when large errors are especially undesirable. Python Code from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error import numpy as np actual = [ 50 , 60 , 55 , 70 , 65 ] predicted = [ 48 , 65 , 53 , 75 , 60 ] mse = mean_squared_error ( actual , predicted ) rmse = np . sqrt ( mse ) print ( \"RMSE:\" , rmse ) Manual MSE Calculation (without library) # Manual MSE calculation errors = [(a - p) ** 2 for a, p in zip(actual, predicted)] mse_manual = sum(errors) / len(errors) print(\"Manual MSE:\", mse_manual) \ud83d\udccc What is R2 \u2013 Score? R\u00b2 Score (also called the coefficient of determination ) is a metric that shows how well your regression model fits the data. It tells you the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables . Interpretation of R\u00b2: R\u00b2 Value Meaning 1.0 Perfect fit (model explains 100% of the variance) 0.9 Very good fit 0.5 Moderate fit 0 Model does no better than the mean < 0 Model is worse than just predicting the mean \u2705 Real-Life Example from sklearn.metrics import r2_score actual = [ 50 , 60 , 55 , 70 , 65 ] predicted = [ 48 , 65 , 53 , 75 , 60 ] r2 = r2_score ( actual , predicted ) print ( \"R\u00b2 Score:\" , r2 ) \ud83d\udccc Summary: Metric What it Tells MAE Average error in same units as target MSE Penalizes large errors more RMSE Similar to MAE, but penalizes big errors R\u00b2 How well the model explains variability \ud83d\udccc Comparison of Common Error Metrics: Metric Description Sensitive to Outliers? Units? Use When... MAE (Mean Absolute Error) Average of absolute errors \u274c No Same as target You want a simple, robust metric. Errors should be equally weighted. MSE (Mean Squared Error) Average of squared errors \u2705 Yes Squared units You want to penalize large errors more heavily . Often used in optimization. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) Square root of MSE \u2705 Yes Same as target Similar to MSE, but easier to interpret (in original units).

Let\u2019s take a straightforward example related to weather forecasting: the first point is related to answering \u201cwhat is the chance that it will rain tomorrow?\u201d while the second point is related to answering \u201cshould I take an umbrella tomorrow?\u201d. When it comes to the scikit-learn API, the first point is addressed by providing scores using predict_proba or decision_function . The former returns conditional probability estimates P(y/X) for each class, while the latter returns a decision score for each class. The decision corresponding to the labels is obtained with predict . In binary classification, a decision rule or action is then defined by thresholding the scores, leading to the prediction of a single class label for each sample. For binary classification in scikit-learn, class labels predictions are obtained by hard-coded cut-off rules: a positive class is predicted when the conditional probability P(y/X) is greater than 0.5 (obtained with predict_proba) or if the decision score is greater than 0 (obtained with decision_function). Here, we show an example that illustrates the relatonship between conditional probability estimatesP(y/X) and class labels: from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier X , y = make_classification ( random_state = 0 ) classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier ( max_depth = 2 , random_state = 0 ) . fit ( X , y ) classifier . predict_proba ( X [: 4 ]) classifier . predict ( X [: 4 ]) While these hard-coded rules might at first seem reasonable as default behavior, they are most certainly not ideal for most use cases. Let\u2019s illustrate with an example. Consider a scenario where a predictive model is being deployed to assist physicians in detecting tumors. In this setting, physicians will most likely be interested in identifying all patients with cancer and not missing anyone with cancer so that they can provide them with the right treatment. In other words, physicians prioritize achieving a high recall rate. This emphasis on recall comes, of course, with the trade-off of potentially more false-positive predictions, reducing the precision of the model. That is a risk physicians are willing to take because the cost of a missed cancer is much higher than the cost of further diagnostic tests. Consequently, when it comes to deciding whether to classify a patient as having cancer or not, it may be more beneficial to classify them as positive for cancer when the conditional probability estimate is much lower than 0.5.

A Decision Tree helps us to make decisions by mapping out different choices and their possible outcomes.It\u2019s used in machine learning for tasks like classification and prediction. A Decision Tree helps us make decisions by showing different options and how they are related. It has a tree-like structure that starts with one main question called the root node which represents the entire dataset. From there, the tree branches out into different possibilities based on features in the data. Root Node: Starting point representing the whole dataset. Branches: Lines connecting nodes showing the flow from one decision to another. Internal Nodes: Points where decisions are made based on data features. Leaf Nodes: End points of the tree where the final decision or prediction is made. A Decision Tree also helps with decision-making by showing possible outcomes clearly. By looking at the \"branches\" we can quickly compare options and figure out the best choice. There are mainly two types of Decision Trees based on the target variable: Classification Trees: Used for predicting categorical outcomes like spam or not spam. These trees split the data based on features to classify data into predefined categories. Regression Trees: Used for predicting continuous outcomes like predicting house prices. Instead of assigning categories, it provides numerical predictions based on the input features. \ud83d\udccc How Decision Trees Work? 1. Start with the Root Node: It begins with a main question at the root node which is derived from the dataset\u2019s features. 2. Ask Yes/No Questions: From the root, the tree asks a series of yes/no questions to split the data into subsets based on specific attributes. 3. Branching Based on Answers: Each question leads to different branches: If the answer is yes, the tree follows one path. If the answer is no, the tree follows another path. 4. Continue Splitting: This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step. 5. Reach the Leaf Node: The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made. Let\u2019s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time: 1. In the morning: It asks \u201cTired?\u201d If yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee. If no, it says no coffee is needed. In the afternoon: It asks again \u201cTired?\u201d If yes, it suggests drinking coffee. If no, no coffee is needed. \ud83d\udccc Splitting Criteria in Decision Trees In a Decision Tree, the process of splitting data at each node is important. The splitting criteria finds the best feature to split the data on. Common splitting criteria include Gini Impurity and Entropy . Gini Impurity: This criterion measures how \"impure\" a node is. The lower the Gini Impurity the better the feature splits the data into distinct categories. Entropy: This measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in the data. The tree tries to reduce the entropy by splitting the data on features that provide the most information about the target variable. These criteria help decide which features are useful for making the best split at each decision point in the tree. \ud83d\udccc Gini Impurity and Entropy in Decision Tree Gini Index The Gini Index is the additional approach to dividing a decision tree. Purity and impurity in a junction are the primary focus of the Entropy and Information Gain framework. The Gini Index, also known as Impurity, calculates the likelihood that somehow a randomly picked instance would be erroneously cataloged. 1. Gini Impurity 2. Entropy (Information Gain) 3.

Also, we have seen how we can calculate Gini Impurity/Entropy for a split/feature. But the major question that arises here is why do we need to have both methods for computation and which is better. The internal workings of both methods are similar, as they are used for computing the impurity of features after each split. However, Gini Impurity is generally more computationally efficient than entropy. The graph of entropy increases up to 1 and then starts decreasing, while Gini Impurity only goes up to 0.5 before decreasing, thus requiring less computational power. The range of entropy is from 0 to (log2C), whereas the range of Gini Impurity is from 0 to 0.5 (for binary classification) . Note : The range of Gini Impurity [ 0 , 0.5 ] is in case of a binary classification problem . In case of multi - class classification , you can calculate range using this method : However, the main reason for Gini Impurity's computational advantage is that it does not involve logarithmic functions, which are more computationally intensive. Therefore, Gini Impurity is often considered more efficient compared to entropy for selecting the best features. Pruning in Decision Trees Pruning is an important technique used to prevent overfitting in Decision Trees. Overfitting occurs when a tree becomes too deep and starts to memorize the training data rather than learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. This technique reduces the complexity of the tree by removing branches that have little predictive power. It improves model performance by helping the tree generalize better to new data. It also makes the model simpler and faster to deploy. It is useful when a Decision Tree is too deep and starts to capture noise in the data. Advantages of Decision Trees Easy to Understand: Decision Trees are visual which makes it easy to follow the decision-making process. Versatility: Can be used for both classification and regression problems. No Need for Feature Scaling: Unlike many machine learning models, it don\u2019t require us to scale or normalize our data. Handles Non-linear Relationships: It capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and outcomes effectively. Interpretability: The tree structure is easy to interpret helps in allowing users to understand the reasoning behind each decision. Handles Missing Data: It can handle missing values by using strategies like assigning the most common value or ignoring missing data during splits. Disadvantages of Decision Trees Overfitting: They can overfit the training data if they are too deep which means they memorize the data instead of learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on unseen data. Instability: It can be unstable which means that small changes in the data may lead to significant differences in the tree structure and predictions. Bias towards Features with Many Categories: It can become biased toward features with many distinct values which focuses too much on them and potentially missing other important features which can reduce prediction accuracy. Difficulty in Capturing Complex Interactions: Decision Trees may struggle to capture complex interactions between features which helps in making them less effective for certain types of data. Computationally Expensive for Large Datasets: For large datasets, building and pruning a Decision Tree can be computationally intensive, especially as the tree depth increases. Applications of Decision Trees Decision Trees are used across various fields due to their simplicity, interpretability and versatility lets see some key applications: Loan Approval in Banking: Banks use Decision Trees to assess whether a loan application should be approved. The decision is based on factors like credit score, income, employment status and loan history. This helps predict approval or rejection helps in enabling quick and reliable decisions. Medical Diagnosis: In healthcare they assist in diagnosing diseases. For example, they can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on clinical data like glucose levels, BMI and blood pressure. This helps classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories, supporting early diagnosis and treatment. Predicting Exam Results in Education: Educational institutions use to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on factors like attendance, study time and past grades. This helps teachers identify at-risk students and offer targeted support. Customer Churn Prediction: Companies use Decision Trees to predict whether a customer will leave or stay based on behavior patterns, purchase history, and interactions. This allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers. Fraud Detection: In finance, Decision Trees are used to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud. By analyzing past transaction data and patterns, Decision Trees can identify suspicious activities and flag them for further investigation.

Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses many decision trees to make better predictions. Each tree looks at different random parts of the data and their results are combined by voting for classification or averaging for regression. This helps in improving accuracy and reducing errors. Working of Random Forest Algorithm Create Many Decision Trees: The algorithm makes many decision trees each using a random part of the data. So every tree is a bit different. Pick Random Features: When building each tree it doesn\u2019t look at all the features (columns) at once. It picks a few at random to decide how to split the data. This helps the trees stay different from each other. Combine the Predictions: For classification we choose a category as the final answer is the one that most trees agree on i.e majority voting. For regression we predict a number as the final answer is the average of all the trees predictions. Implementing Random Forest for Classification Tasks Here we will predict survival rate of a person in titanic. Import libraries and load the Titanic dataset. Remove rows with missing target values ('Survived'). Select features like class, sex, age, etc and convert 'Sex' to numbers. Fill missing age values with the median. Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a Random Forest model. Predict on test data, check accuracy and print a sample prediction result. import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score , classification_report import warnings warnings . filterwarnings ( 'ignore' ) url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv\" titanic_data = pd . read_csv ( url ) titanic_data = titanic_data . dropna ( subset = [ 'Survived' ]) X = titanic_data [[ 'Pclass' , 'Sex' , 'Age' , 'SibSp' , 'Parch' , 'Fare' ]] y = titanic_data [ 'Survived' ] X . loc [:, 'Sex' ] = X [ 'Sex' ] . map ({ 'female' : 0 , 'male' : 1 }) X . loc [:, 'Age' ] . fillna ( X [ 'Age' ] . median (), inplace = True ) X_train , X_test , y_train , y_test = train_test_split ( X , y , test_size = 0.2 , random_state = 42 ) rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier ( n_estimators = 100 , random_state = 42 ) rf_classifier . fit ( X_train , y_train ) y_pred = rf_classifier . predict ( X_test ) accuracy = accuracy_score ( y_test , y_pred ) classification_rep = classification_report ( y_test , y_pred ) print ( f \"Accuracy: { accuracy : .2f } \" ) print ( \" \\n Classification Report: \\n \" , classification_rep ) sample = X_test . iloc [ 0 : 1 ] prediction = rf_classifier . predict ( sample ) sample_dict = sample . iloc [ 0 ] . to_dict () print ( f \" \\n Sample Passenger: { sample_dict } \" ) print ( f \"Predicted Survival: { 'Survived' if prediction [ 0 ] == 1 else 'Did Not Survive' } \" ) We evaluated model's performance using a classification report to see how well it predicts the outcomes and used a random sample to check model prediction. Implementing Random Forest for Regression Tasks We will do house price prediction here. Load the California housing dataset and create a DataFrame with features and target. Separate the features and the target variable. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test). Initialize and train a Random Forest Regressor using the training data. Predict house values on test data and evaluate using MSE and R\u00b2 score.

These techniques increase the model\u2019s accuracy and stability. \ud83d\udccc What is Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)? Ridge regression is a technique used to address overfitting by adding a penalty to the model's complexity. It introduces an L2 penalty (also called L2 regularization) which is the sum of the squares of the model's coefficients. This penalty term reduces the size of large coefficients but keeps all features in the model. This prevents overfitting with correlated features. Formula for Ridge Regression: \ud83d\udccc Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)? Lasso regression addresses overfitting by adding an L1 penalty i.e sum of absolute coefficients to the model's loss function. This encourages some coefficients to become exactly zero helps in effectively removing less important features. It also helps to simplify the model by selecting only the key features. Formula for Lasso Regression: \ud83d\udccc Elastic Net Regression (L1 + L2 Regularization)? Elastic Net regression combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties to perform feature selection, manage multicollinearity and balancing coefficient shrinkage. This works well when there are many correlated features helps in avoiding the problem where Lasso might randomly pick one and ignore others. Formula for Elastic Net Regression: Lasso vs Ridge vs Elastic Net Features Lasso Regression Ridge Regression Elastic Net Regression Penalty Type L1 Penalty: Uses absolute values of coefficients. L2 Penalty: Uses the square of the coefficients. L1 + L2 Penalty: Combines absolute and square penalties. Effect on Coefficients Completely removes unnecessary features by setting coefficients to zero. Makes all coefficients smaller but does not set them to zero. Removes some features and reduces others by balancing both. Best Use Case Best when we want to remove irrelevant features. Best when all features matter but their impact should be reduced. Best when features are correlated and feature selection is needed. Hyperparameters Involved Alpha: Controls regularization strength (higher alpha = more shrinkage). Alpha: Same as Lasso for controlling regularization strength. Alpha + L1_ratio: Alpha controls strength; L1_ratio balances Lasso & Ridge. Bias and Variance High bias, low variance. Low bias, high variance. Balanced bias and variance. Strengths Automatically chooses important features. Works well when features are related but shouldn\u2019t be completely removed. Combines Lasso\u2019s feature selection with Ridge\u2019s handling of correlations. Weaknesses May remove useful features if not tuned well. Keeps all features, which may not help in high-dimensional irrelevant data. Harder to tune due to having two parameters. Example With 100 features to predict house prices, sets irrelevant features (like house color) to zero. With 100 features, reduces the impact of all features but doesn\u2019t remove any. If \u201csize\u201d and \u201crooms\u201d are similar, removes one and shrinks the other.

K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups unlabeled dataset into different clusters. It is used to organize data into groups based on their similarity . \ud83d\udccc Understanding K-means Clustering For example online store uses K-Means to group customers based on purchase frequency and spending creating segments like Budget Shoppers, Frequent Buyers and Big Spenders for personalised marketing. The algorithm works by first randomly picking some central points called centroids and each data point is then assigned to the closest centroid forming a cluster. After all the points are assigned to a cluster the centroids are updated by finding the average position of the points in each cluster. This process repeats until the centroids stop changing forming clusters. The goal of clustering is to divide the data points into clusters so that similar data points belong to same group. \ud83d\udccc How k-means clustering works? We are given a data set of items with certain features and values for these features like a vector. The task is to categorize those items into groups. To achieve this we will use the K-means algorithm. 'K' in the name of the algorithm represents the number of groups/clusters we want to classify our items into. The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups or clusters of similarity.To calculate that similarity we will use the Euclidean distance as a measurement. The algorithm works as follows: First we randomly initialize k points called means or cluster centroids . We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the mean's coordinates , which are the averages of the items categorized in that cluster so far. We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters. In K-Means: You start with some initial cluster centers (means) . These means are just points in your feature space . There are two common ways to choose them: Pick random data points as means. Pick random values within the range of the dataset . Suppose you have this dataset: Customer ID Age (x1) Income (x2 in \\$K) 1 25 40 2 30 45 3 35 50 4 60 100 5 65 105 This is a 2D dataset (Age and Income). \u2705 Method 1: Initialize means using random data points We randomly choose k=2 actual rows as our initial centers: Mean 1 = (25, 40) Mean 2 = (60, 100) These are real customers , just chosen as starting points. \u2705 Method 2: Initialize means using random values within feature ranges Here, we use the min and max of each feature: Age: min = 25, max = 65 \u21d2 range = [25, 65] Income: min = 40, max = 105 \u21d2 range = [40, 105] Now randomly generate any values within this box: Mean 1 = (30.5, 80.2) \u2190 random numbers between 25\u201365 and 40\u2013105 Mean 2 = (58.3, 45.0) \ud83e\udd14 Why do we need different ways? Random points from the dataset: safer, avoids outliers. Random values in the feature space: more flexible, but risky if the range has irrelevant areas (e.g., outliers can skew the range). \ud83d\udd01 After Initialization No matter how you initialize: K-Means will iteratively adjust the means by: Assigning each point to the nearest mean. Recomputing each mean as the average of its assigned points . The algorithm stops when the means stop changing significantly. Summary: Method Example Notes Pick random data points (25, 40), (60, 100) Easy, safe Pick random values in range (30.5, 80.2), (58.3, 45.0) More flexible, but riskier \ud83d\udccc Example: K-Means Initialization Methods with Visualization import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import random # Sample dataset: [Age, Income] data = np . array ([ [ 25 , 40 ], [ 30 , 45 ], [ 35 , 50 ], [ 60 , 100 ], [ 65 , 105 ] ]) # Function to initialize centroids using method 1 (random points from data) def init_random_points ( data , k = 2 ): indices = random . sample ( range ( len ( data )), k ) return data [ indices ] # Function to initialize centroids using method 2 (random values within range) def init_random_values ( data , k = 2 ): mins = data . min ( axis = 0 ) maxs = data . max ( axis = 0 ) return np . array ([ np . random . uniform ( mins , maxs ) for _ in range ( k )]) # Initialize np . random . seed ( 42 ) # for reproducibility k = 2 means_method1 = init_random_points ( data , k ) means_method2 = init_random_values ( data , k ) # Plotting plt . figure ( figsize = ( 8 , 6 )) plt . scatter ( data [:, 0 ], data [:, 1 ], c = 'blue' , label = 'Data Points' ) plt . scatter ( means_method1 [:, 0 ], means_method1 [:, 1 ], c = 'green' , marker = 'X' , s = 200 , label = 'Method 1: Data Points' ) plt . scatter ( means_method2 [:, 0 ], means_method2 [:, 1 ], c = 'red' , marker = 'P' , s = 200 , label = 'Method 2: Random Values' ) plt . xlabel ( \"Age\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Income ($K)\" ) plt . title ( \"K-Means Initialization Methods\" ) plt . legend () plt . grid ( True ) plt . show () \ud83d\udcca What You'll See: Blue dots = original customer data (Age vs. Income) Green 'X' markers = initial means chosen from actual data points Red 'P' markers = initial means from random values inside feature range This will help you visually compare how these two initialization strategies place the cluster centers. \ud83d\udccc Euclidean Distance Euclidean Distance is defined as the distance between two points in Euclidean space.To find the distance between two points, the length of the line segment that connects the two points should be measured. Euclidean distance is like measuring the straightest and shortest path between two points . Imagine you have a string and you stretch it tight between two points on a map; the length of that string is the Euclidean distance. It tells you how far apart the two points are without any turns or bends, just like a bird would fly directly from one spot to another. This metric is based on the Pythagorean theorem and is widely utilized in various fields such as machine learning, data analysis, computer vision, and more. Euclidean Distance Formula Consider two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2-dimensional space; the Euclidean Distance between them is given by using the formula: Where, d is Euclidean Distance, (x1, y1) is the Coordinate of the first point, (x2, y2) is the Coordinate of the second point. Euclidean Distance in 3D If the two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) are in a 3-dimensional space, the Euclidean Distance between them is given by using the formula: Where, d is Euclidean Distance, (x1, y1, z1) is the Coordinate of the first point, (x2, y2, z2) is the Coordinate of the second point. Euclidean Distance in nD In general, the Euclidean Distance formula between two points (x11, x12, x13, ...., x1n) and (x21, x22, x23, ...., x2n) in an n-dimensional space is given by the formula: Where, i Ranges from 1 to n, d is Euclidean distance, (x11, x12, x13, ...., x1n) is the Coordinate of the First Point, (x21, x22, x23, ...., x2n) is the Coordinate of the Second Point. Euclidean Distance Formula Derivation Euclidean Distance Formula is derived by following the steps added below: Step 1: Let us consider two points, A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2), and d is the distance between the two points. Step 2: Join the points using a straight line (AB). Step 3: Now, let us construct a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is AB, as shown in the figure below. Step 4: Now, using Pythagoras theorem we know that, Note: Selecting the right number of clusters is important for meaningful segmentation to do this we use Elbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeans which is a graphical tool used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in K-means. \ud83d\udccc Elbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeans Choosing the optimal number of clusters is a crucial step in any unsupervised learning algorithm. Since we don\u2019t have predefined cluster counts in unsupervised learning, we need a systematic approach to determine the best k value. The Elbow Method is a popular technique used for this purpose in K-Means clustering. \ud83d\udccc Elbow Method in K-Means Clustering In K-Means clustering, we start by randomly initializing k clusters and iteratively adjusting these clusters until they stabilize at an equilibrium point. However, before we can do this, we need to decide how many clusters (k) we should use. The Elbow Method helps us find this optimal k value. Here\u2019s how it works: We iterate over a range of k values, typically from 1 to n (where n is a hyper-parameter you choose). For each k, we calculate the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) . The Elbow Point: Optimal k Value The Elbow Method works in below steps: We calculate a distance measure called WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) . This tells us how spread out the data points are within each cluster. We try different k values (number of clusters). For each k, we run KMeans and calculate the WCSS. We plot a graph with k on the X-axis and WCSS on the Y-axis. Identifying the Elbow Point: As we increase kkk, the WCSS typically decreases because we're creating more clusters, which tend to capture more data variations. However, there comes a point where adding more clusters results in only a marginal decrease in WCSS. This is where we observe an \"elbow\" shape in the graph. Before the elbow: Increasing kkk significantly reduces WCSS, indicating that new clusters effectively capture more of the data's variability. After the elbow: Adding more clusters results in a minimal reduction in WCSS, suggesting that these extra clusters may not be necessary and could lead to overfitting. The goal is to identify the point where the rate of decrease in WCSS sharply changes, indicating that adding more clusters (beyond this point) yields diminishing returns. This \"elbow\" point suggests the optimal number of clusters. \ud83d\udccc Understanding Distortion and Inertia in K-Means Clustering In K-Means clustering, we aim to group similar data points together. To evaluate the quality of these groupings, we use two key metrics: Distortion and Inertia . 1. Distortion Distortion measures the average squared distance between each data point and its assigned cluster center. It's a measure of how well the clusters represent the data. A lower distortion value indicates better clustering. 2. Inertia Inertia is the sum of squared distances of each data point to its closest cluster center. It's essentially the total squared error of the clustering. Like distortion, a lower inertia value suggests better clustering. In the Elbow Method, we calculate the distortion or inertia for different values of k (number of clusters). We then plot these values to identify the \"elbow point\", where the rate of decrease in distortion or inertia starts to slow down. This elbow point often indicates the optimal number of clusters. A Lower Distortion or Inertia is Generally Better A lower distortion or inertia implies that the data points are more closely grouped around their respective cluster centers. However, it's important to balance this with the number of clusters. Too few clusters might not capture the underlying structure of the data, while too many clusters can lead to overfitting. By understanding distortion and inertia, we can effectively evaluate the quality of K-Means clustering and select the optimal number of clusters. \ud83d\udccc Implementation of Elbow Method In this section, we will demonstrate how to implement the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using Python's Scikit-learn library. We will create a random dataset, apply K-means clustering, calculate the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different values of k, and visualize the results to determine the optimal number of clusters. \ud83d\udccc Step 1: Importing the required libraries from sklearn.cluster import KMeans from sklearn import metrics from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \ud83d\udccc Step 2: Creating and Visualizing the data We will create a random array and visualize its distribution # Creating the dataset x1 = np . array ( [ 3 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 9 , 9 , 8 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 4 ] ) x2 = np . array ( [ 5 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 5 , 8 , 6 , 7 , 6 , 7 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 , 9 , 10 ] ) X = np . array ( list ( zip ( x1 , x2 ))) . reshape ( len ( x1 ) , 2 ) # Visualizing the data plt . scatter ( x1 , x2 , marker = 'o' ) plt . xlim ( [ 0 , 10 ] ) plt . ylim ( [ 0 , 10 ] ) plt . title ( 'Dataset Visualization' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Feature 1' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Feature 2' ) plt . show () From the above visualization, we can see that the optimal number of clusters should be around 3. But visualizing the data alone cannot always give the right answer. Hence we demonstrate the following steps. \ud83d\udccc Step 3: Building the Clustering Model and Calculating Distortion and Inertia In this step, we will fit the K-means model for different values of k (number of clusters) and calculate both the distortion and inertia for each value. distortions = [] inertias = [] mapping1 = {} mapping2 = {} K = range ( 1 , 10 ) for k in K : kmeanModel = KMeans ( n_clusters = k , random_state = 42 ). fit ( X ) distortions . append ( sum ( np . min ( cdist ( X , kmeanModel . cluster_centers_ , 'euclidean' ), axis = 1 ) ** 2 ) / X . shape [ 0 ] ) inertias . append ( kmeanModel . inertia_ ) mapping1 [ k ] = distortions [ -1 ] mapping2 [ k ] = inertias [ -1 ] \ud83d\udccc Step 4: Tabulating and Visualizing the Results a) Displaying Distortion Values print ( \"Distortion values:\" ) for key , val in mapping1 . items () : print ( f '{key} : {val}' ) plt . plot ( K , distortions , 'bx-' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Number of Clusters (k)' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Distortion' ) plt . title ( 'The Elbow Method using Distortion' ) plt . show () b) Displaying Inertia Values: \ud83d\udccc Step 5: Clustered Data Points For Different k Values We will plot images of data points clustered for different values of k. For this, we will apply the k-means algorithm on the dataset by iterating on a range of k values. k_range = range(1, 5) for k in k_range: kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', random_state=42) y_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(X) plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, cmap='viridis', marker='o', edgecolor='k', s=100) plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=300, c='red', label='Centroids', edgecolor='k') plt.title(f'K-means Clustering (k={k})') plt.xlabel('Feature 1') plt.ylabel('Feature 2') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() Key Takeaways The Elbow Method helps you choose the optimal number of clusters (k) in KMeans clustering. It analyzes how adding more clusters (increasing k) affects the spread of data points within each cluster (WCSS). The k value corresponding to the \"elbow\" in the WCSS vs k graph is considered the optimal choice. The Elbow Method provides a good starting point, but consider your specific data and goals when finalizing k. \ud83d\udcca Use Case: Customer Segmentation for Marketing \ud83c\udfaf Objective A retail company wants to segment its customers based on purchasing behavior so that it can: Run personalized marketing campaigns, Identify high-value customers, Improve customer retention. \ud83d\udcc1 Dataset [Kaggle][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis] \ud83d\udcd8 Dataset Overview This dataset, available at Kaggle as Customer Personality Analysis by imakash3011, includes 2,240 customer records with 29 features , covering demographic info, household characteristics, spending on products, and campaign responses Key feature groups: People: ID, Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Dt_Customer, Recency, Complain Product Purchases (last 2 years): MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds Promotion Behavior: NumDealsPurchases, AcceptedCmp1\u2013AcceptedCmp5, Response Purchasing Channels: NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth \ud83e\udde0 Step-by-Step: Build K-Means Real-world Model 1.

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data , meaning there are no predefined outputs or target variables . i.e., we don't give output to our model . The training model has only input parameter values and discovers the groups or patterns on its own . Key Concept: The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns, structures , or relationships in the data without any human guidance. The image shows set of animals: elephants, camels, and cows that represents raw data that the unsupervised learning algorithm will process. The \"Interpretation\" stage signifies that the algorithm doesn't have predefined labels or categories for the data. It needs to figure out how to group or organize the data based on inherent patterns. Algorithm represents the core of unsupervised learning process using techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection to identify patterns and structures in the data. Processing stage shows the algorithm working on the data. The output shows the results of the unsupervised learning process. In this case, the algorithm might have grouped the animals into clusters based on their species (elephants, camels, cows). \ud83d\udccc How does unsupervised learning work? Unsupervised learning works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own. The model tries to find similarities, clusters, or distributions in the data. It does not know in advance what the output should be. It learns from the structure or distribution of the data itself . \ud83d\udccc Common Techniques: Technique Description Example Use Case Clustering Group similar data points together. Customer segmentation (e.g., K-Means) Dimensionality Reduction Reduce number of features while preserving variance. Visualizing high-dimensional data (e.g., PCA) Anomaly Detection Detect unusual data points. Fraud detection, network intrusion detection Association Rules Find rules showing relationships between variables. Market basket analysis (e.g., Apriori) \ud83d\udce6 Example: Input Data: Age Income 25 40K 27 42K 50 150K 52 160K Output: The algorithm (e.g., K-Means) may group the people into below group Without being told these categories in advance. Group 1: Younger, lower income Group 2: Older, higher income \u2705 Applications: Customer segmentation Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon) Anomaly/fraud detection Document or image clustering Summary: Unsupervised learning helps machines discover the unknown in data, making it especially powerful for exploratory analysis and feature discovery. \ud83d\udccc Challenges of Unsupervised Learning: 1. No Ground Truth (No Labels) Why it's hard: There\u2019s no \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to evaluate against. Impact: Difficult to measure accuracy or performance objectively. 2. Choosing the Right Algorithm Why it's hard: Many algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, etc.) work well on specific types of data. Impact: Poor algorithm choice can lead to meaningless results. 3. Determining the Number of Clusters or Components Why it's hard: You often don\u2019t know how many groups (e.g., clusters) are in the data. Example: How many customer segments exist in a marketing dataset? 4. High Dimensionality Why it's hard: More features (dimensions) make it harder to find meaningful patterns due to the curse of dimensionality . Solution: Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) \u2014 but this adds complexity. 5. Interpreting Results Why it's hard: Outputs like clusters or embeddings are abstract and not always clearly interpretable. Impact: Hard for stakeholders to understand or validate findings. 6. Sensitivity to Noise and Outliers Why it's hard: Unsupervised algorithms may group noise or outliers into their own cluster or distort existing ones. Example: K-Means can be pulled off-center by outliers. 7. Scalability and Computation Why it's hard: Large datasets with high dimensions can make clustering and similarity computations slow or memory-intensive. 8. Initialization Sensitivity Why it's hard: Some algorithms (e.g., K-Means) rely on random initialization, which can lead to different results each time. 9. Lack of Objective Evaluation Metrics Why it's hard: No standard metrics like accuracy or precision. Alternatives: Use metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies\u2013Bouldin Index, or visualizations \u2014 but they're approximate.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Models/Ollama.html","text":"\u2705 Ollama \ud83d\udccc What is Ollama?

Input text String Convert all letters of the string to one case(either lower or upper case) If numbers are essential to convert to words else remove all numbers Remove punctuations, other formalities of grammar Remove white spaces Remove stop words And any other computations Text normalization with above-mentioned steps, every step can be done in some ways.

Tokenization is a fundamental process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a stream of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can range from individual characters to full words or phrases, Based on how detailed it needs to be. By converting text into these manageable chunks, machines can more effectively analyze and understand human language. \ud83d\udccc Types of Tokenization Word Tokenization: This is the most common method where text is divided into individual words. It works well for languages with clear word boundaries, like English. Character Tokenization: In this method, text is split into individual characters. This is particularly useful for languages without clear word boundaries or for tasks that require a detailed analysis, such as spelling correction. Subword Tokenization: Sub-word tokenization strikes a balance between word and character tokenization by breaking down text into units that are larger than a single character but smaller than a full word. SentenceTokenization: Sentence tokenization is also a common technique used to make a division of paragraphs or large set of sentences into separated sentences as tokens. N-gram Tokenization N-gram tokenization splits words into fixed-sized chunks (size = n) of data \ud83d\udccc Tokenization Challenges Implementing Tokenization NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) SpaCy BERT Tokenizer Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Sentence Piece \ud83d\udccc Lemmatization Lemmatization reduces words to their base or root form. Lemmatization is an important text pre-processing technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base form known as a \"lemma.\" For example, the lemma of \"running\" is \"run\" and \"better\" becomes \"good.\" Unlike stemming which simply removes prefixes or suffixes, it considers the word's meaning and part of speech (POS) and ensures that the base form is a valid word. This makes lemmatization more accurate as it avoids generating non-dictionary words. It is used for: Improves accuracy: It ensures words with similar meanings like \"running\" and \"ran\" are treated as the same. Reduced Data Redundancy: By reducing words to their base forms, it reduces redundancy in the dataset. This leads to smaller datasets which makes it easier to handle and process large amounts of text for analysis or training machine learning models. Better NLP Model Performance: By treating all similar word as same, it improves the performance of NLP models by making text more consistent. For example, treating \"running,\" \"ran\" and \"runs\" as the same word improves the model's understanding of context and meaning. \ud83d\udccc Lemmatization Techniques There are different techniques to perform lemmatization each with its own advantages and use cases: 1. Rule Based Lemmatization In rule-based lemmatization, predefined rules are applied to a word to remove suffixes and get the root form. This approach works well for regular words but may not handle irregularities well. For example: Rule: For regular verbs ending in \"-ed,\" remove the \"-ed\" suffix . Example: \"walked\" -> \"walk\" While this method is simple and interpretable, it doesn't account for irregular word forms like \"better\" which should be lemmatized to \"good\". 2. Dictionary-Based Lemmatization It uses a predefined dictionary or lexicon such as WordNet to look up the base form of a word. This method is more accurate than rule-based lemmatization because it accounts for exceptions and irregular words. For example: 'running' -> 'run' 'better' -> 'good' 'went' -> 'go \"I was running to become a better athlete and then I went home,\" -> \"I was run to become a good athlete and then I go home.\" By using dictionaries like WordNet this method can handle a range of words effectively, especially in languages with well-established dictionaries. 3. Machine Learning-Based Lemmatization It uses algorithms trained on large datasets to automatically identify the base form of words. This approach is highly flexible and can handle irregular words and linguistic nuances better than the rule-based and dictionary-based methods. For example: A trained model may deduce that \u201cwent\u201d corresponds to \u201cgo\u201d even though the suffix removal rule doesn\u2019t apply. Similarly, for 'happier' the model deduces 'happy' as the lemma. Machine learning-based lemmatizers are more adaptive and can generalize across different word forms which makes them ideal for complex tasks involving diverse vocabularies. Step 1: Installing NLTK and Downloading Necessary Resources In Python, the NLTK library provides an easy and efficient way to implement lemmatization. First, we need to install the NLTK library and download the necessary datasets like WordNet and the punkt tokenizer. !pip install nltk Now lets import the library and download the necessary datasets. import nltk nltk . download ( 'punkt_tab' ) nltk . download ( 'wordnet' ) nltk . download ( 'omw-1.4' ) nltk . download ( 'averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng' ) Step 2: Lemmatizing Text with NLTK Now we can tokenize the text and apply lemmatization using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer. from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer () text = \"The cats were running faster than the dogs.\" tokens = word_tokenize ( text ) lemmatized_words = [ lemmatizer . lemmatize ( word ) for word in tokens ] print ( f \"Original Text: { text } \" ) print ( f \"Lemmatized Words: { lemmatized_words } \" ) Step 3: Improving Lemmatization with Part of Speech (POS) Tagging To improve the accuracy of lemmatization, it\u2019s important to specify the correct Part of Speech (POS) for each word. By default, NLTK assumes that words are nouns when no POS tag is provided. However, it can be more accurate if we specify the correct POS tag for each word. For example: \"running\" (as a verb) should be lemmatized to \"run\". \"better\" (as an adjective) should be lemmatized to \"good\". from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize from nltk import pos_tag from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer () sentence = \"The children are running towards a better place.\" tokens = word_tokenize ( sentence ) tagged_tokens = pos_tag ( tokens ) def get_wordnet_pos ( tag ): if tag . startswith ( 'J' ): return 'a' elif tag . startswith ( 'V' ): return 'v' elif tag . startswith ( 'N' ): return 'n' elif tag . startswith ( 'R' ): return 'r' else : return 'n' lemmatized_sentence = [] for word , tag in tagged_tokens : if word . lower () == 'are' or word . lower () in [ 'is' , 'am' ]: lemmatized_sentence . append ( word ) else : lemmatized_sentence . append ( lemmatizer . lemmatize ( word , get_wordnet_pos ( tag ))) print ( \"Original Sentence: \" , sentence ) print ( \"Lemmatized Sentence: \" , ' ' . join ( lemmatized_sentence )) \ud83d\udccc Stemming Stemming reduces works to their root by removing suffixes. Types of stemmers include: Stemming is an important text-processing technique that reduces words to their base or root form by removing prefixes and suffixes. This process standardizes words which helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In NLP, stemming simplifies words to their most basic form, making it easier to analyze and process text. For example, \"chocolates\" becomes \"chocolate\" and \"retrieval\" becomes \"retrieve\". This is important in the early stages of NLP tasks where words are extracted from a document and tokenized (broken into individual words). It helps in tasks such as text classification , information retrieval and text summarization by reducing words to a base form. While it is effective, it can sometimes introduce drawbacks including potential inaccuracies and a reduction in text readability. Examples of stemming for the word \"like\": \"likes\" \u2192 \"like\" \"liked\" \u2192 \"like\" \"likely\" \u2192 \"like\" \"liking\" \u2192 \"like\" Porter Stemmer Porter's Stemmer is one of the most popular and widely used stemming algorithms. Proposed in 1980 by Martin Porter, this stemmer works by applying a series of rules to remove common suffixes from English words. It is well-known for its simplicity, speed and reliability. However, the stemmed output is not guaranteed to be a meaningful word and its applications are limited to the English language. Example: 'agreed' \u2192 'agree' Rule: If the word has a suffix EED (with at least one vowel and consonant) remove the suffix and change it to EE . Advantages: Very fast and efficient. Commonly used for tasks like information retrieval and text mining. Limitations: Outputs may not always be real words. Limited to English words. from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer () words = [ \"running\" , \"jumps\" , \"happily\" , \"running\" , \"happily\" ] stemmed_words = [ porter_stemmer . stem ( word ) for word in words ] print ( \"Original words:\" , words ) print ( \"Stemmed words:\" , stemmed_words ) Snowball Stemmer The Snowball Stemmer is an enhanced version of the Porter Stemmer which was introduced by Martin Porter as well. It is referred to as Porter2 and is faster and more aggressive than its predecessor. One of the key advantages of this is that it supports multiple languages, making it a multilingual stemmer. Example: 'running' \u2192 'run' 'quickly' \u2192 'quick' Advantages: More efficient than Porter Stemmer. Supports multiple languages. from nltk.stem import SnowballStemmer stemmer = SnowballStemmer ( language = 'english' ) words_to_stem = [ 'running' , 'jumped' , 'happily' , 'quickly' , 'foxes' ] stemmed_words = [ stemmer . stem ( word ) for word in words_to_stem ] print ( \"Original words:\" , words_to_stem ) print ( \"Stemmed words:\" , stemmed_words ) \ud83d\udccc Stopword removal Stopword removal is a process to remove common words from the document. Natural language processing tasks often involve filtering out commonly occurring words that provide no or very little semantic value to text analysis. These words are known as stopwords include articles, prepositions and pronouns like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\" and \"in\". While they seem insignificant, proper stopword handling can dramatically impact the performance and accuracy of NLP applications. When to Remove Stopwords The decision to remove stopwords depends heavily on the specific NLP task at hand: Tasks that benefit from stopword removal: Text classification and sentiment analysis Information retrieval and search engines Topic modelling and clustering Keyword extraction Tasks that require preserving stopwords: Machine translation (maintains grammatical structure) Text summarization (preserves sentence coherence) Question-answering systems (syntactic relationships matter) Grammar checking and parsing import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize nltk . download ( 'stopwords' ) nltk . download ( 'punkt' ) # Sample text text = \"This is a sample sentence showing stopword removal.\" # Get English stopwords and tokenize stop_words = set ( stopwords . words ( 'english' )) tokens = word_tokenize ( text . lower ()) # Remove stopwords filtered_tokens = [ word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words ] print ( \"Original:\" , tokens ) print ( \"Filtered:\" , filtered_tokens ) \ud83d\udccc Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging assigns a part of speech to each word in sentence based on definition and context. Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging \u2705 Text representation Techniques It converts textual data into numerical vectors that are processed by the following methods: \ud83d\udccc Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging One-Hot Encoding Bag of Words (BOW) In Natural Language Processing (NLP) text data needs to be converted into numbers so that machine learning algorithms can understand it. One common method to do this is Bag of Words (BoW) model. It turns text like sentence, paragraph or document into a collection of words and counts how often each word appears but ignoring the order of the words. It does not consider the order of the words or their grammar but focuses on counting how often each word appears in the text. This makes it useful for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis and clustering. Key Components of BoW Vocabulary: It is a list of all unique words from the entire dataset. Each word in the vocabulary corresponds to a feature in the model. Document Representation: Each document is represented as a vector where each element shows the frequency of the words from the vocabulary in that document. The frequency of each word is used as a feature for the model. \ud83d\udccc Steps to Implement the Bag of Words (BoW) Model Step 1: Preprocessing the Text Before applying the BoW model, we need to preprocess the text. This includes: Converting the text to lowercase Removing non-word characters Removing extra spaces Lets consider a sample text for this implementation: Beans .

We will store these counts in a pandas DataFrame to view them easily in a tabular format. We initialize a dictionary to hold our word counts. Then, we tokenize each sentence into words. For each word, we check if it exists in our dictionary. If it does, we increment its count. If it doesn\u2019t, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. word2count = {} for data in dataset : words = nltk . word_tokenize ( data ) for word in words : if word not in word2count : word2count [ word ] = 1 else : word2count [ word ] += 1 stop_words = set ( stopwords . words ( 'english' )) filtered_word2count = { word : count for word , count in word2count . items () if word not in stop_words } word_freq_df = pd . DataFrame ( list ( filtered_word2count . items ()), columns =[ 'Word', 'Frequency' ] ) word_freq_df = word_freq_df . sort_values ( by = 'Frequency' , ascending = False ) print ( word_freq_df ) Step 3: Selecting the Most Frequent Words Now that we have counted the word frequencies, we will select the top N most frequent words (e.g top 10) to be used in the BoW model. We can visualize these frequent words using a bar chart to understand the distribution of words in our dataset. import heapq import matplotlib.pyplot as plt freq_words = heapq . nlargest ( 10 , word2count , key = word2count . get ) print ( f \"Top 10 frequent words: { freq_words } \" ) top_words = sorted ( word2count . items (), key = lambda x : x [ 1 ], reverse = True )[: 10 ] words , counts = zip ( * top_words ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) plt . bar ( words , counts , color = 'skyblue' ) plt . xticks ( rotation = 45 ) plt . title ( 'Top 10 Most Frequent Words' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Words' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Frequency' ) plt . show () Step 4: Building the Bag of Words (BoW) Model Now we will build the Bag of Words (BoW) model. This model is represented as a binary matrix where each row corresponds to a sentence and each column represents one of the top N frequent words. A 1 in the matrix shows that the word is present in the sentence and a 0 shows its absence. We will use a heatmap to visualize this binary matrix where green shows the presence of a word (1) and red shows its absence (0). import numpy as np import seaborn as sns X = [] for data in dataset : vector = [] for word in freq_words : if word in nltk . word_tokenize ( data ): vector . append ( 1 ) else : vector . append ( 0 ) X . append ( vector ) X = np . asarray ( X ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) sns . heatmap ( X , cmap = 'RdYlGn' , cbar = False , annot = True , fmt = \"d\" , xticklabels = freq_words , yticklabels = [ f \"Sentence { i + 1 } \" for i in range ( len ( dataset ))]) plt . title ( 'Bag of Words Matrix' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Frequent Words' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Sentences' ) plt . show () Step 5: Visualizing Word Frequencies with a Word Cloud Finally, we can create a Word Cloud to visually represent the word frequencies. In a word cloud, the size of each word is proportional to its frequency which makes it easy to identify the most common words at a glance. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) TF-IDF (Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical method used in natural language processing and information retrieval to evaluate how important a word is to a document in relation to a larger collection of documents. TF-IDF combines two components: 1. Term Frequency (TF): Measures how often a word appears in a document. A higher frequency suggests greater importance. If a term appears frequently in a document, it is likely relevant to the document\u2019s content. 2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Reduces the weight of common words across multiple documents while increasing the weight of rare words. If a term appears in fewer documents, it is more likely to be meaningful and specific. This balance allows TF-IDF to highlight terms that are both frequent within a specific document and distinctive across the text document, making it a useful tool for tasks like search ranking, text classification and keyword extraction. Converting Text into vectors with TF-IDF Let's take an example where we have a corpus (a collection of documents) with three documents and our goal is to calculate the TF-IDF score for specific terms in these documents. Document 1: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" Document 2: \"The dog played in the park.\" Document 3: \"Cats and dogs are great pets.\" Our goal is to calculate the TF-IDF score for specific terms in these documents. Let\u2019s focus on the word \"cat\" and see how TF-IDF evaluates its importance. Step 1: Calculate Term Frequency (TF) For Document 1: The word \"cat\" appears 1 time. The total number of terms in Document 1 is 6 (\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"). So, TF(cat,Document 1) = 1/6 For Document 2: The word \"cat\" does not appear. So, TF(cat,Document 2)=0. For Document 3: The word \"cat\" appears 1 time. The total number of terms in Document 3 is 6 (\"cats\", \"and\", \"dogs\", \"are\", \"great\", \"pets\"). So TF (cat,Document 3)=1/6 In Document 1 and Document 3 the word \"cat\" has the same TF score. This means it appears with the same relative frequency in both documents. In Document 2 the TF score is 0 because the word \"cat\" does not appear.

Although there are many metrics which can be potentially used for measuring performance of a classification model, some of the main metrics are listed below Confusion matrix\u2013 This is one of the most important and most commonly used metrics for evaluating the classification accuracy. Typically on the x-axis \u201ctrue classes\u201d are shown and on the y axis \u201cpredicted classes\u201d are represented. Confusion Matrix is applicable for both binary and multi class classification. See the cat and dog classification example listed. In the below example, let\u2019s pretend that we have built a classification algorithm to identify Dogs ( Positive Class) from a total of 100 animals where in reality 70 animals are Dogs (Positive Class) and 30 are Cats (Negative Class). Predicted: Positive Predicted: Negative Actual: Positive True Positive (TP) False Negative (FN) Actual: Negative False Positive (FP) True Negative (TN) \u2705 2. Key Metrics Explained # TP = Model predicted Positive and it's actually Positive TN = Model predicted Negative and it's actually Negative FP = Model predicted Positive but it's actually Negative FN = Model predicted Negative but it's actually Positive \ud83d\udd39 Accuracy: # This measures model\u2019s overall performance in correctly identifying all classes.This metric is valid for both binary and multi-class classification however this is not very robust for the unbalanced data and we should use Precision and Recall metrics instead How often the model is correct overall. \ud83d\udd39 Precision: # When a model identifies an observation as a positive, this metric measure the performance of the model in correctly identifying the true positive from the false positive. This is a very robust matrix for multiclass classification and the unbalanced data. The closer the Precision value to 1, the better the model Out of the predicted positives, how many are actually positive? \ud83d\udd39 Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): # This metric measures a model\u2019s performance in identifying the true positive out of the total true positive cases. The closer the Recall value to 1, the better the model. As is the case with the Precision metric, this metric is a very robust matrix for multi-class classification and the unbalanced data. Out of all actual positives, how many did the model catch? \u2705 Example # Suppose you're building a spam classifier. You test it on 100 emails, and get: TP = 40 (Spam correctly identified as spam) TN = 50 (Not spam correctly identified as not spam) FP = 5 (Not spam incorrectly identified as spam) FN = 5 (Spam incorrectly identified as not spam) \ud83d\udcca Confusion Matrix # Predicted: Spam Predicted: Not Spam Actual: Spam 40 (TP) 5 (FN) Actual: Not Spam 5 (FP) 50 (TN) \ud83d\udd22 Calculated Metrics # Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (40 + 50) / 100 = 90% Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 40 / (40 + 5) = 88.9% Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 40 / (40 + 5) = 88.9% \u2705 When to Use What? # Metric Best Used When... Accuracy Classes are balanced and cost of errors is equal. Precision False positives are costly (e.g., predicting a healthy person has diabatic).

Foundations of Statistical Machine Learning: # Statistics and Machine Learning: Statistics provides the tools for understanding data (descriptive statistics, probability distributions), while machine learning provides the algorithms for building predictive models. Data Exploration and Preparation: Statistical methods help in understanding data distributions, identifying outliers, and selecting relevant features for modeling. Probability and Distributions: Understanding probability distributions is crucial for modeling and evaluating machine learning models. 2. Key Statistical Concepts and Techniques: # Descriptive Statistics: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), variability (variance, standard deviation), and distribution shape help summarize and understand data. Hypothesis Testing: Used to compare populations, assess the significance of results, and evaluate model performance (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests). Resampling Methods: Techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping are used to estimate model performance on unseen data, especially when data is limited. Estimation Statistics: Focuses on estimating parameters and their uncertainty using confidence intervals, prediction intervals, etc. Nonparametric Methods: Used when data doesn't meet the assumptions of parametric tests (e.g., t-tests). 3. Applications in Machine Learning: # Model Building: Statistics provides the foundation for building various machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. Model Evaluation: Statistical techniques like p-values, confidence intervals, and R-squared help in assessing the performance and reliability of machine learning models. Feature Selection and Engineering: Statistics helps in identifying relevant features and transforming data for better model performance. Interpreting Results: Statistical concepts help in understanding the meaning and significance of model predictions. 4. Examples: # Linear Regression: Uses the method of least squares, a statistical technique, to find the best-fitting line that explains the relationship between variables. Hypothesis Testing: Can be used to determine if a new model significantly outperforms an existing one. Cross-validation: A resampling technique used to estimate how well a model will generalize to unseen data. Statistics For Machine Learning # Machine Learning Statistics: In the field of machine learning (ML), statistics plays a pivotal role in extracting meaningful insights from data to make informed decisions. Statistics provides the foundation upon which various ML algorithms are built, enabling the analysis, interpretation, and prediction of complex patterns within datasets. Types of Statistics Descriptive Statistics Measures of Dispersion Measures of Shape Covariance and Correlation Visualization Techniques Probability Theory Inferential Statistics Population and Sample Estimation Hypothesis Testing ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) Chi-Square Tests: Correlation and Regression Bayesian Statistics Types of Statistics # There are commonly two types of statistics. Descriptive Statistics: \"De\u00adscriptive Statistics\" helps us simplify and organize big chunks of data. This makes large amounts of data easier to understand. Inferential Statistics: \"Inferential Statistics\" is a little different. It uses smaller data to draw conclusions about a larger group. It helps us predict and draw conclusions about a population. Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset, providing a foundation for further statistical analysis. Measures of Dispersion Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values. Variance: The average squared deviation from the mean, representing data spread. Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, indicating data spread relative to the mean. Interquartile Range: The range between the first and third quartiles, measuring data spread around the median. Measures of Shape Skewness: Indicates data asymmetry. Kurtosis: Measures the peakedness of the data distribution. Covariance and Correlation # Visualization Techniques # Histograms: Show data distribution. Box Plots: Highlight data spread and potential outliers. Scatter Plots: Illustrate relationships between variables. Probability Theory # Probability theory forms the backbone of statistical inference, aiding in quantifying uncertainty and making predictions based on data. Basic Concepts Random Variables: Variables with random outcomes. Probability Distributions: Describe the likelihood of different outcomes. Common Probability Distributions # Binomial Distribution: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. Poisson Distribution: Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval. Normal Distribution: Characterizes continuous data symmetrically distributed around the mean. Law of Large Numbers: # States that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean. Central Limit Theorem: # Indicates that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size grows, regardless of the population's distribution. Inferential Statistics # Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Population and Sample # Population: The entire group being studied. Sample: A subset of the population used for analysis. Estimation # Point Estimation: Provides a single value estimate of a population parameter. Interval Estimation: Offers a range of values (confidence interval) within which the parameter likely lies. Confidence Intervals: Indicate the reliability of an estimate. Hypothesis Testing # Null and Alternative Hypotheses: The null hypothesis assumes no effect or relationship, while the alternative suggests otherwise. Type I and Type II Errors: Type I error is rejecting a true null hypothesis, while Type II is failing to reject a false null hypothesis. p-Values: Measure the probability of obtaining the observed results under the null hypothesis. t-Tests and z-Tests: Compare means to assess statistical significance. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): # Compares means across multiple groups to determine if they differ significantly. Chi-Square Tests: # Assess the association between categorical variables. Correlation and Regression: # Understanding relationships between variables is critical in machine learning. Correlation: Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures linear relationship strength between two variables. Spearman Rank Correlation: Assesses the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between variables. Regression Analysis Simple Linear Regression: Models the relationship between two variables. Multiple Linear Regression: Extends to multiple predictors. Assumptions of Linear Regression: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality. Interpretation of Regression Coefficients: Explains predictor influence on the response variable. Model Evaluation Metrics: R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, RMSE. Bayesian Statistics # Bayesian statistics incorporate prior knowledge with current evidence to update beliefs. P(A\u2223B)=P(B)P(B\u2223A)\u22c5P(A)\u200b, where P(A\u2223B): The probability of event A given that event B has occurred (posterior probability). P(B\u2223A): The probability of event B given that event A has occurred (likelihood). P(A): The probability of event A occurring (prior probability). P(B): The probability of event B occurring. Descriptive Statistic # Statistics is the foundation of data science. Descriptive statistics are simple tools that help us understand and summarize data.They show the basic features of a dataset, like the average, highest and lowest values and how spread out the numbers are. It's the first step in making sense of information. Types of Descriptive Statistics # There are three categories for standard classification of descriptive statistics methods, each serving different purposes in summarizing and describing data. They help us understand: Where the data centers (Measures of Central Tendency) How spread out the data is (Measure of Variability) How the data is distributed (Measures of Frequency Distribution) Measures of Central Tendency Statistical values that describe the central position within a dataset . There are three main measures of central tendency: Mean: is the sum of observations divided by the total number of observations. It is also defined as average which is the sum divided by count. The mean() function from Python\u2019s statistics module is used to calculate the average of a set of numeric values. It adds up all the values in a list and divides the total by the number of elements. mean_age_data = df['age'].mean() mode_age_data = df['age'].mode() median_age_data = df['age'].median() print(\"mean age:\",round(mean_age_data)) print(\"mode age:\", mode_age_data) print(\"median age:\", median_age_data) where, - x = Observations - n = number of terms Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It\u2019s useful for categorical data and in cases where knowing the most common choice is crucial.

Examples: - Calculating the average score of students in a class. - Creating a bar chart showing the number of people in different age groups. - Finding median income in a city. - Standard deviation showing how spread-out exam scores are. Inferential Statistics # Definition: Inferential statistics use a sample of data to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population. Purpose: To draw conclusions, test hypotheses, and estimate population parameters. Examples: - Using a survey of 1000 voters to predict election results for the entire country. - Performing a t-test to compare the effectiveness of two different medicines. - Estimating the average height of all adults in a city using a random sample.

Topics Covered: Missing Value Handling, Linear Interpolation, Data Imputation Probability, Hypothesis Testing, and Statistical Tests # Introduction to Probability and Distributions, Identifying Distributions Understanding Hypothesis Testing One Sample and 2 Sample t Tests ANOVA, Chi-Square Test What is Probability # Why is Probability Important in Statistics? # What is a probability distribution # Normal Distribution # Binomial Distribution # Poisson Distribution # Uniform Distribution # Identifying Types of Distributions # Hypothesis Testing # A hypothesis is simply a claim or assumption we want to test using data. Two Types of Hypotheses: Null Hypothesis (H\u2080): \"There is no effect, no difference, nothing unusual.\"\u2192 It's like the default assumption. Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081): \"There is an effect or difference.\"\u2192 What you're trying to prove. Goal of Hypothesis Testing: Use sample data to decide if we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Example (Real Life): You want to test if a new teaching method improves scores. H\u2080: The new method is no better than the old one. H\u2081: The new method improves scores. You collect exam data and use statistics to decide if the score increase is real or due to chance. Hypothesis Testing Example # Think of a hypothesis test like a court trial. H0 (Null Hypothesis): Accused is innocent. H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): Accused is guilty. Just like in a trial, we assume the accused (H0) is innocent unless proven guilty. We collect sample data, like presenting evidence in court. The p-value tells us: If the accused were truly innocent (H0), what is the chance of seeing this kind of evidence? If the p-value is very low (e.g., < 0.05), it's like strong evidence in court. So we reject H0 and declare the accused guilty (accept H1). Important: Like a real trial, we never 'prove' innocence or guilt - we assess based on evidence! What is p value # Key Terms Hypothesis Testing # Steps in Hypothesis Testing # Define H0 and H1 Choose significance level (alpha) Select the test (t-test, ANOVA, etc.) Compute test statistic and p-value Compare p-value to alpha and draw conclusion One-Sample t-test # Used when comparing sample mean to a known/population mean Example: Is average delivery time > 30 minutes? Demo in Excel or Python Independent Two-Sample t-test # Used to compare means of two independent groups Example: Test scores of two teaching methods Assumptions: Normality, Equal variances ANOVA # ANOVA = Analysis of Variance Compares means across 3 or more groups H0: All group means are equal If p < 0.05, at least one group is different Chi-Square Test # For categorical data (e.g., Gender vs Purchase) Tests independence between variables Compares observed vs expected frequencies Hands on examples # Probability Question Dataset : [ Students Performance in Exams ( Kaggle ) ] ( https : // www . kaggle . com / datasets / spscientist / students - performance - in - exams ) Problem : Calculate the probability that a randomly selected student scored more than 80 in math .

Let me break down the key aspects of time series, especially relevant if you're doing forecasting, anomaly detection, or trend analysis: Temporal Order # Definition: Observations are collected at specific time intervals (daily, monthly, yearly, etc.). Importance: Order matters; past values influence future ones. Components of Time Series # Trend: Long-term increase or decrease in the data.(E.g., sales increasing over years due to company growth.) Seasonality: Repeating short-term cycles (e.g., sales spike every December).(Can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.) Cyclic Patterns: Fluctuations over long, non-fixed periods.(Usually driven by economic conditions or business cycles.) Irregular (Noise): Random variation; not explained by trend/seasonality.(Often treated as residuals in models.) Goal: Use past data to forecast future values Time Series is data collected at regular time intervals. Examples: - Daily stock prices - Monthly rainfall - Hourly website traffic Stationarity & Non-stationary in Time Series # Stationary series: Mean, variance, autocorrelation are constant over time.

The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It\u2019s a measure of central tendency , used to represent the typical value in a dataset. \ud83d\udd22 Formula: Mean = Sum of all values / Number of values \ud83e\udde0 Real-Time Example: Retail Sales # Suppose you're a retail manager tracking daily sales for a week. Day Sales (\u20b9) Monday 10,000 Tuesday 12,000 Wednesday 9,000 Thursday 11,000 Friday 10,000 Saturday 20,000 Sunday 18,000 \u2795 Step 1: Sum of sales Total Sales = 10,000+12,000+9,000+11,000+10,000+20,000+18,000=\u20b990,000 \u2797 Step 2: Number of days = 7 \ud83d\udcca Step 3: Calculate Mean Mean Sales = \u20b990,000 / 7 = \u20b912,857.14 \ud83d\udcd8 Interpretation: On average, your store made \u20b912,857.14 per day during the week. \u26a0\ufe0f When Mean Can Be Misleading # If one day had an unusually high or low sale, it would affect the mean significantly. For example, if Saturday = \u20b9100,000, the mean would rise sharply, even though it's not typical for the week. \u2705 When to Use Mean Use Case Use Mean? Why? Data without outliers \u2705 Yes Accurately reflects central value Symmetric distribution \u2705 Yes Mean = Median \u2248 Mode Data with outliers or skew \u274c Use Median Mean may be distorted \u2705 What is a Symmetric Distribution?(Normal/Bell Curve) A symmetric distribution is a type of probability distribution where the left and right sides are mirror images of each other when plotted on a graph. | | * | * * | * * | * * | * * | * * |---*-----------------------*--- |<-------- CENTER ----------->| Mean = Median = Mode \ud83d\udd39 Characteristics: The peak is in the center, and the tails decrease equally on both sides. Perfect mirror image on both sides. Mean = Median = Mode all at the center. \ud83e\udde0 Key Characteristics # Feature Description Mirror-like shape Left side \u2248 Right side Mean = Median = Mode All measures of central tendency are equal No skew Skewness = 0 (perfect symmetry) Bell-shaped (often) Many symmetric distributions look like a bell \ud83d\udfe2 Example of Symmetric Distributions # 1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian) Classic example of symmetry Appears in real-world data like heights, IQ scores, blood pressure 2. Uniform Distribution All values equally likely, so symmetry exists across the range \ud83d\udcca Real-Time Example: Human Heights # Suppose you measure the heights of 10,000 adult men: Most are around 5'9\" (175 cm) Fewer are below 5'6\" or above 6'2\" The distribution looks like a bell curve \u27a4 That\u2019s a symmetric distribution centered at the average height. \ud83d\udeab Not Symmetric? \u2192 It\u2019s Skewed Type Description Left-skewed (negative) Tail longer on left; mean < median Right-skewed (positive) Tail longer on right; mean > median \u2705 Why Symmetric Distributions Matter Make statistical modeling easier Help justify using the mean as a reliable average Used in many algorithms (e.g., z-scores, standardization) \ud83d\udd36 2. Right-Skewed Distribution (Positively Skewed) | | * | * * | * * | * * | * * | * * |*------------------*----- |<---|---- CENTER ----> Mode < Median < Mean \ud83d\udd39 Characteristics: Long tail to the right (higher values). Mean is pulled right by outliers. Examples: income, housing prices, website load time. \ud83d\udd37 3. Left-Skewed Distribution (Negatively Skewed) | | * | * * | * * | * * | * * | * * |-----*----------------*--- | CENTER ---->---> Mean < Median < Mode \ud83d\udd39 Characteristics: Long tail to the left (lower values). Mean is pulled left by small outliers.
